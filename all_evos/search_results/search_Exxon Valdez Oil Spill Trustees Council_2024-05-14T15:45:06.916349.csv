"1","df35c.9.10","urn:node:GOA","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration treatment effects studies from 1989 through 1997 suggested that bivalve assemblages on beaches in Prince William Sound treated with high-pressure washing were severely injured in terms of abundance, species composition, and function. Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

We found that average EROD activity differed between areas during 2005, although the magnitude of the difference was reduced relative to a previous study from 1996/1997, and we found that areas did not differ by 2009. Similarly, we found that the proportion of individuals captured from oiled areas with elevated EROD activity (P2 times unoiled average) declined from 41% in winter 1996/1997 to 10% in 2005 and 15% in 2009. This work adds to a body of literature describing the timelines over which vertebrates were exposed to residual Exxon Valdez oil and indicates that, for Barrow’s goldeneyes in Prince William Sound, exposure persisted for many years with evidence of substantially reduced exposure by 2 decades after the spill.","Cytochrome P4501A biomarker in Barrow’s goldeneyes, USGS, US Fish and Wildlife, 2005 and 2009","Daniel Esler"

colonies within the trajectory of the oil to determine whether numbers had declined and to
evaluate the effects of oil on nesting phenology and reproductive success, following the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The colonies we surveyed contained the majority of the estimated
200,000 murres attending colonies in the affected area, and we found reduced numbers at all
study colonies following the spill. In addition, nesting was delayed and productivity rates
were far below normal following the spill. In contrast, numbers of murres did not decline and
reproductive parameters were normal at 2 colonies we surveyed outside the trajectory.
The only indication of recovery since the spill was a slight increase in reproductive success at
monitored colonies in 1991. The most likely cause of reduced numbers of murres at cliffs
following the oil spill was direct mortality from the oil. Since breeding murres were
congregating near colonies at the time of the spill, most murres killed were probably
experienced breeders. We concluded that reduced densities and skewed age structures were
the most likely causes of abnormal breeding after the spill.","Effects of EVOS on abundances and reproduction of Murre colonies, near PWS, coastal Kenai and Alaska Peninsulas, and Kodiak Island (1989-1991).","David Nysewander"

Due to their occurrence in nearshore habitats and consumption of benthic invertebrate prey, Barrow’s goldeneyes are particularly susceptible to continued exposre to residual Exxon-Valdez oil and thus, are potentially vulnerable to subsequent physiological and population level effects. Continued oil exposure through 1997 was indicated by higher induction of cytochrome P450 1A in birds from oiled areas than unoiled.","Cytochrome P4501A Induction in Sea Ducks Inhabiting Nearshore Areas of Prince William Sound, Alaska, US Fish and Wildlife, USGS, 1996","Kimberly Trust"

Phase I was conducted in summer 1989/spring 1990 and involved site selection/ground truthing. Phase II involved intensive evaluation of study sites to determine extent of injury to natural resources in supratidal, intertidal and subtidal areas. Phase II commenced in the fall of 1989 and continued through the summer of 1991. The supratidal component was completed in 1991 and a final report was submitted separately. The subtidal portion was integrated into a suite of other subtidal studies and findings were also reported separately.

Abstract: The Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment Study was initiated to assess injury to intertidal habitats impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The study, conducted from 1989-1991, encompassed three major geographical areas impacted by the spill: Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet-Kenia Peninsula and Kodiak-Alaska Peninsula. Oiled sites were selected randomly and matched with non-oiled sites and classified into sheltered rocky, exposed rocky, coarse textured or estuarine habitat. Statistically significant differences between oiled and non-oiled sites were interpreted as impact due to the spill and/or clean-up activities. Most observed differences varied across regions, habitats and tidal heights. Algae, especially the perennial Fucus, was generally negatively impacted on oiled sites. Conversely, an increase in annual and ephemeral species in the lower intertidal occurred. Limpets, mussels, littorines, and the high cockscomb prickleback were injured by the spill, while oligochaetes and a single barnacle species were enhanced at most tidal heights following the spill. Although intertidal communities showed widespread impact from oiling/clean-up activities for algal, invertebrate and fish components, data revealed most habitats were recovering but had fully recovered by 1991.

"18","df35f.14.20","urn:node:GOA","Lingering oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill persists on some beaches in Prince William Sound, Alaska, more than 20 years after they became contaminated. Bioremediation was tested in pilot-scale studies during 2011 and 2012 to determine whether this technology could be used to restore these sites. Pilot-scale bioremediation systems were installed at four sites with lingering contamination in 2011 and at two of those sites in 2012.

The technology relied on delivering solutions of dissolved oxygen (at 40 mg/L) and nutrients (nitrogen at 20 mg/L and phosphorus 2.0 mg/L) into the beachest to enhance oil biodegradation. Sediment samples were obtained to analyze for oil and microbial communities, and pore water samples were taken to analyze for oxygen, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and salinity. There was no clear temporal or spatial pattern of behavior of oil (obtained as total extractable material from the sediments). The sum of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and dibenzothiophene, labelled herein as total PAH (TPAH) was used as the main indicator of bioremediation. The TPAH biodegradation rate at PWS3A44 was 72% and that at EL056C in 2011 was 35% suggesting very effective bioremediation. However the rate at other beaches and/or in other years varied from 13% to 26%, with an average of 16%, which reflects a four-fold enhancement on the natural biodegradation rate of oil in beaches, which was estimated at less than 4% per year. In general, the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the pore water increased following treatment and so did the concentrations of nitrogen from nitrate and phosphorous. Microbial counts using the most probable numbers (MPN) revealed that the MPN of PAH degraders was an order of magnitude smaller than that of alkanes, and it decreased with time, suggesting depletion of the PAH. A beach survey for bioremediation potential revealed that two beaches out of 23 received a “bio-score” of 100 suggesting that bioremediation on these beaches would be effective in removing the TPAH at approximately 16% per year.","Pilot Studies of Bioremediation of the Exxon Valdez Oil in Prince William Sound Beaches, Alaska: 2010-2011","Michel Boufadel"

Although positive trends in population numbers were found on two FWS and three UW plots at East Amatuli Island-Light Rock over the postspill period, no trends were apparent on larger sections of habitat at this colony or at the nearby Nord Island-Northwest Islet nesting complex. Nesting chronology was similar between study sites and about one week earlier than during 1993. Productivity also did not differ between study sites. In general, reproductive success in the Barren Islands was normal to high, compared with other Gulf of Alaska murres colonies.","Common Murre Restoration Monitoring in the Barren Islands, AK, 1993-1994","David Roseneau"

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.

Induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) in vertebrates occurs in response to exposure
to a limited number of compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as
those found in crude oil and have been used to evaluate exposure to inducing compounds in many cases of environmental contamination, including that of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Elevated CYP1A has been demonstrated in several species in areas of Prince William Sound. 

The data presented here quantifies CYP1A induction by the amount of hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufinO-deethylase (EROD) activity, which is a well-established method and is the same approach used in earlier Exxon Valdez studies and in similar studies of harlequin ducks
and other sea ducks elsewhere.

Year 3 will verify the impact on herring of the high numbers of humpback whales we observed in PWS during year 2.

Previous laboratory or hatchery studies demonstrate that resistance of eggs to mechanical damage increases with maturity, but applicability to natural populations requires an understanding of embryo age distributions and the ability to discriminate between sampler-induced egg mortality and natural mortality. Resistance of naturally spawned eggs to hydraulic shock, determined six times between late September and mid-November in a southeastern Alaska stream, increased sigmoidally from less than 2% to 98%. In contrast, the number of eggs that died from natural causes was unrelated to sample time. Rapid removal of all eggs from the water allowed accurate discrimination between shocked and eggs dead prior to sampling, an improved method we recommend for future studies. The rate of shock resistance increase was slower in naturally spawned eggs than in uniform-age embryos subjected to the same hydraulic shock. We caution that combining shocked and dead eggs into one 'dead' category does not accurately describe natural mortality.

Sampling water from the sea chest of the ship at 4m, the underway system measured: (1) temperature and salinity: basic physical variables, (2) nitrate: an essential phytoplankton nutrient, (3) chlorophyll fluorescence: an indicator of phytoplankton concentration, (4) colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence: an indicator of terrestrial runoff, and (5) optical beam transmittance: an indicator of suspended sediment. The measurements show large spatial variability at short time scales, but spatially coherent climate change over annual time scales. Governed by snow and ice melt, the ocean climate transitioned from a warm, fresh regime in 2004-2005 to a cold, salty regime in 2007-2008. Agreement with observations at the GAK1 monitoring site near Seward, AK, extends their applicability to the northern Gulf of Alaskas continental shelf. Nitrate and chlorophyll measurements show nutrient-rich periods lead to increased phytoplankton. A computer monitor displayed the water temperature along the route and mapped the progress of the ferry. The successful measurement program and connections to long-term climate change demonstrate the utility of oceanographic measurements from ferryboats.

The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office).

Our total (day and night) acoustic sockeye salmon smolt abundance estimates were likely biased high due to noise from entrained air created by boat traffic and perhaps greater schooling of other fish species during the day. Our mark-recapture abundance estimates were likely biased low, because the traps were only operated during the night due to very low catches during the day. Although, the precision of the acoustic abundance estimates was higher than the mark-recapture estimates, we could not conclude that either method was superior, because the estimates provided by both methods appeared to be biased in different ways. Therefore, actual smolt abundance was probably between the total acoustic (day and night) and mark-recapture estimates. Sockeye salmon smolt weight tended to decline as the contribution of marine derived nutrients in smolt tissues increased supporting the conclusion that negative density dependence was the primary mechanism regulating growth. 

This dataset contains (1) counts of fish by species captured in inclined-plane smolt traps operated on the Kenai River (rkm 71.4), (2) age, weight, length data for sockeye salmon smolt captured in the traps, (3) lengths of fish released and recaptured in dye-marking experiments, (4) stable istope compositions for sockeye salmon smolts, (5) acoustic estimates of smolt abundance, and (6) physical data (water temperature, conductivity, relative depth, Secchi depth).

"51","df35d.441.2","urn:node:GOA","In 1975 EPA produced effluent discharge guidelines for the seafood processor industry that required wastes to be ground to less than 1.27 cm prior to discharge. Subsequently, several negative impacts were observed around Cordova, including noticeable decreases in crab and halibut harvests and a substantial increase in numbers of gulls. We hypothesized that the change removed a food source for the large bottom-oriented animals and increased availability to the surface-oriented gulls. In 2004, we began a three year study to examine impacts of seafood waste discharge into Orca Inlet, including evaluation of alternative discharge and disposal methods. The study included model development and control-treatment experiments. We developed a dispersal model that incorporated both physical and biological transport mechanisms and demonstrated improvements over current practices. We dumped over 325,000 lbs of salmon heads and carcasses at an experimental site and monitored the biotic response. Methodologies included underwater cameras, traps, acoustic tags attached to salmon heads and visual surveys of birds and marine mammals. The results show that the heads and carcasses disperse rapidly and are efficiently incorporated into the food chain with no negative consequences, a very favorable contrast to the current EPA-mandated practice. The model also revealed that the historic practice of dumping fish carcasses was a far more effective recycling mechanism. In fact fish production may have been substantially reduced with the change in disposal practices since natural recycling is hindered by the discharge of ground waste. We conclude that it is overdue for some rethinking of fish waste practices. The policy of grinding fish waste to the same 1/2"" grind size that was historically used for sewage wastes in the 1970's needs to change. We need to better understand natural recycling with regard to disposal practices. Fish processing waste is potentially a healthy source of food for marine fauna. In locations like Orca Inlet ground discharge of fish waste is not only deleterious but may also substantially reduce fish production by hindering natural recycling.

During the summer of 2004 and the spring of 2005 physical oceanographic conditions were measured in three regions of Orca Inlet, near Cordova Alaska, investigated as potential locations for the alternative disposal of fish offal from Cordova’s seafood processors. Two of the regions were surveyed in July and September 2004, including a northern site next to Salmo Point and North Island and a southern site within lower Orca Inlet adjacent to Cordova. A third region was surveyed in May 2005 along a channel that connects the southeastern and northeastern portions of the inlet. The data included profiles of currents, temperature and salinity taken over semi-diurnal tidal cycles. All three sites differ significantly in both hydrography and circulation due to a number of factors including variation in bottom depths, basin geometry, sources of freshwater input, and the strength and pattern of the tidal currents. The northern site is characterized by both high stratification from freshwater originating from glacial runoff into the Rude River and deep inflow of cold, saline water advected from Orca Bay. This region therefore becomes highly stratified in the summer and baroclinic currents occur over depth throughout the tidal cycle. The currents also exhibit significant spatial variation ranging from < 5 to 50 cm/sec due to convergences and divergences caused by both estuarine input and bathymetric effects. In contrast, lower Orca Inlet is characterized by strong, barotrophic flows (>100 cm/sec), and all inputs of heat and freshwater (including glacial sources advected from the north) are rapidly dissipated due to turbulent mixing. The northeastern channel also exhibits barotrophic flows similar in magnitude to lower Orca Inlet, but in contrast to the latter site vertical mixing produces fronts extending to depth as stratified water from Nelson Bay is advected across a shallow region and undergoes tidal mixing. All three locations would potentially serve as fish offal discharge sites if maximum dispersion is the goal. The northern site, however, may achieve better results due to its deep (80m) basin and the baroclinic nature of the currents. The higher population of ground fish in this region would also benefit more from disposal of offal at this site.

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as ω3:ω6. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.

Eelgrass beds in heavily oiled bays were exposed to moderate concentrations of hydrocarbons.  In 1990, a year after the spill, concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons averaged nearly 4,000 ng g-1 dry weight of sediment at oiled sites compared to less than 700 ng g-1 at reference sites.  Injuries to eelgrass, if any, appeared to be slight and did not persist for more than a year after the spill.  There were possible impacts to the average density of shoots and flowering shoots, as these were 24% and 62% lower at oiled than at reference sites in 1990 (P<0.10 for both).  However, there were no differences between oiled and reference sites with respect to eelgrass biomass, seed density, seed germination, or the incidence of normal mitosis in seedlings, and there were no signs of the elimination of eelgrass beds.  Populations recovered from  possible injuries by 1991, as there was a sharp decline in hydrocarbon concentrations and there were no differences in shoot or flowering shoot densities between oiled and reference sites in 1990 or subsequent years.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage by sampling various treated and untreated sites in 2002. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. 

Abstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska.

Since 1993, the council has monitored samples from mussels and sediments at 10 sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. The samples are monitored for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons. Samples are collected in summer and late winter and results are presented in an annual report. This information provides a benchmark for assessing the ongoing impacts of routine tanker and terminal operations. The program has sampled twice a year since 1994 for evidence of hydrocarbons in mussel tissue and sediment samples. In recent years, the program was cut back to just mussel tissue at all sites with subtidal sediments only in Port Valdez (site of Alyeska Marine Terminal's tanker operations). For more complete sampling in Port Valdez, mussels are also collected in October. All samples are analyzed for PAH and AHC; sediments are also analzyed for TOC and sediment grain size. Results from PWSRCAC's studies indicate a variety of sources of hydrocarbons in Prince William Sound including the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, operations at the Alyeska terminal, combustion sources, boating and shipping activities, normal oil seepage or coal deposits, biological processes, and atmospheric fallout. Generally, the hydrocarbon levels detected under LTEMP have been relatively low. The stations farthest from the Alyeska terminal show low hydrocarbon levels, while those closest to the terminal show higher levels. Concern over the hydrocarbon levels at the terminal prompted PWSRCAC to add an additional sampling effort at the two Port Valdez stations in the fall of each year.

Since 1993, the council has monitored samples from mussels and sediments at 10 sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. The samples are monitored for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons. Samples are collected in summer and late winter and results are presented in an annual report. This information provides a benchmark for assessing the ongoing impacts of routine tanker and terminal operations. The program has sampled twice a year since 1994 for evidence of hydrocarbons in mussel tissue and sediment samples. In recent years, the program was cut back to just mussel tissue at all sites with subtidal sediments only in Port Valdez (site of Alyeska Marine Terminal's tanker operations). For more complete sampling in Port Valdez, mussels are also collected in October. All samples are analyzed for PAH and AHC; sediments are also analzyed for TOC and sediment grain size. Results from PWSRCAC's studies indicate a variety of sources of hydrocarbons in Prince William Sound including the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, operations at the Alyeska terminal, combustion sources, boating and shipping activities, normal oil seepage or coal deposits, biological processes, and atmospheric fallout. Generally, the hydrocarbon levels detected under LTEMP have been relatively low. The stations farthest from the Alyeska terminal show low hydrocarbon levels, while those closest to the terminal show higher levels. Concern over the hydrocarbon levels at the terminal prompted PWSRCAC to add an additional sampling effort at the two Port Valdez stations in the fall of each year.

"80","df35i.6.18","urn:node:GOA","Biodegradation was a major mechanism for removing oil resulting from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska. For three field seasons, we examined the hexadecane, phenanthrene, and naphthalene mineralization potentials of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and the accompanying hydrocarbon concentrations from the intertidal and shallow subtidal sediments. We found that mineralization potentials were not directly dependent on sediment substrate concentrations, but environmental factors influenced the ability of microbial populations to mineralize polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic compounds. These factors included the intensity of physical mixing experienced, the treatments received, and the availability of alternative carbon sources. In 1989, when the Exxon Valdez oil was relatively unweathered and before shoreline treatment was begun, the mineralization potentials of aromatic hydrocarbons were high at many sites even in the presence of alkanes at higher concentrations. However, by 1990, mineralization potentials for alkanes were greater than those for aromatics at oiled sites exposed to terrestrial biowaxes or fatty acids from the bioremediation process. Therefore, our study shows that sediment chemistry data alone cannot predict the persistence of hydrocarbons following the Exxon Valdez oil spill and demonstrates the need for systematic ecosystem-level studies of the abiotic and biotic factors influencing biodegradation.

Restoration Project 95026 (continued as 97026) was initiated as part of a detailed study plan in 1994. The project was a synthesis of data collected from prior projects including: (1) NRDA Air/Water Study Number 2 Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Induced Injury to Subtidal Marine Sediment Resources (changed to Subtidal Study Number 1 in 1991). The final reports for Subtidal Study Number 1 (including NRDA Air/Water Study Number 2 data) were submitted in June 1992 (microbiology) and July 1994 (chemistry). (2) Restoration Study Number 93047 Exxon Valdez Restoration Proiect: Subtidal Monitoring. The results of this project are found in two reports, Microbiology of Subtidal Sediments: Monitoring Microbial Populations (Project 93047-2) Recovery of Sediments in the Lower Intertidal and Subtidal Environment (Project 93047-1). A journal article from the current study (Restoration Project 95026) was published in 1997: Sugai, S.F., J.E. Lindstrom and J.F. Braddock. 1997.

"81","df35a.21.22","urn:node:GOA","This dataset contains the short-term survival and tag loss data from tagging of juvenile pink salmon with passive integrated transpondar (PIT) tags in southwestern Prince William Sound, Alaska. The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office). The United States Forest Service (Dirk Lang) also loaned a portable PIT tag reader.","Tag detection and mortality in pink salmon captured in Prince William Sound, Alaska: 2005","Steve Moffitt"

The data from these surveys are part of a pole-to-pole latitudinal biodiversity gradient of macroalgal rocky bottom communities, which is applying standardized protocols developed under the Census of Marine Life program. Georeferenced species occurrence data from this project have been added to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System database. The specific outcomes of this project include biodiversity species lists for each site and core area and various biodiversity analyses. A total of 242 invertebrate species/higher taxa groups and 237 macroalgal species/higher taxa groups were counted and/or weighed. Analyses of invertebrate and macroalgal groups showed that each core area and depth strata had unique descriptive genera/groups, however annual differences were not noted. Analyses also showed that intertidal communities differ in composition, biomass, and diversity than subtidal communities. Also, intertidal communities can not be used as an indicator for subtidal communities. These datasets are informative and should be used for current regional and global comparisons and future longterm monitoring programs.

The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales. Vital rates for AB pod and all other frequently sighted resident pods have been calculated annually based on the photographic data.","Comprehensive Killer Whale Investigation: Annual Photographic Survey Summaries in Alaska 1984 - 2011","Craig Matkin"

Fish/Shellfish Study Number 11 was initiated as a State/Federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment project as part of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill study plan and continued through the 1992 work plan. Most components  of this report were published in October 1996 in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 53(10), followed by one article published in August 1997  in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 54(8). 

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

Phase I was conducted in summer 1989/spring 1990 and involved site selection/ground truthing. Phase II involved intensive evaluation of study sites to determine extent of injury to natural resources in supratidal, intertidal and subtidal areas. Phase II commenced in the fall of 1989 and continued through the summer of 1991. The supratidal component was completed in 1991 and a final report was submitted separately. The subtidal portion was integrated into a suite of other subtidal studies and findsings were also reported separately. Draft preliminary status reports were issued for the intertidal componenet in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 by Highsmith et al. as Coastal Habitat Study No. 1: Phase II in 1990 and 1991 and No. 1A in 1992 and 1993.

Abstract: The CoastalHabitat Injury Assessment Study was initiated to assess injury to intertidal habitats impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The study, conducted from 1989-1991, encompassed three major geographical areas impacted by the spill: Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet-Kenia Peninsula and Kodiak-Alaska Peninsula. Oiled sites were selected randomly and matched with non-oiled sites and classified into sheltered rocky, exposed rocky, coarse textured or estuarine habitat. Statistically significant differences between oiled and non-oiled sites were interpreted as impact due to the spill and/or clean-up activities. Most observed differences varied across regions, habitats and tidal heights. Algae, especially the perennial Fucus, was generally negatively impacted on oiled sites. Conversely, an increase in annual and ephemeral species in the lower intertidal occurred. Limpets, mussels, littorines, and the high cockscomb prickleback were injured by the spill, while oligochaetes and a single barnacle species were enhanced at most tidal heights following the spill. Although intertidal communities showed widespread impact from oiling/clean-up activities for algal, invertebrate and fish components, data revealed most habitats were recovering but had fully recovered by 1991.

Abstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment.

After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, many researchers began measuring hydrocarbon concentrations in mussels, sediment, and other matrices in Prince William Sound to assess resource damage. The specific focus of this project was dense aggregations of intertidal mussels (Mytilus trossulus) within the slick trajectory. Oil accumulated in these filter-feeders; total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were high in 1989 and remained relatively high for several years in mussel beds on unconsolidated sediment. The persistence of oil in these beds in Prince William Sound and along the Gulf of Alaska caused concern, and beginning in 1992 heavily oiled beds were systematically surveyed for oil content in mussel tissue and underlying sediment. Projections from earlier data (through 1995) were that oil would persist for up to three decades, thus funding for study was extended through 1999. This report synthesizes all available natural resource damage assessment data (17 independent studies) to develop a coherent picture of spatial and temporal oil distributions in mussels and sediment.

Abstract: 
Exxon Valdez oil trapped in intertidal sediment in Prince William Sound degraded slowly, was biologically available for at least a decade, and was toxic for at least 9 years. Habitat condition controlled the biological availability of oil. Exposure duration was short where mussels were only exposed to oil in water (months) and long (6 to 10 years) at locations where oil remained in sediment. Limited evidence suggests some oiling extended outside previously reported slick boundaries; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sources were verified with three independent petrogenic composition models. After an initial peak, oil concentrations typically declined in sediment and mussels, although distribution was non-uniform and variability was often high. Oil may persist in some intertidal sediment for >50 years, but declines in mussel tissue suggest it became less available to surface organisms and this community is recovering. Attempts to manually accelerate hydrocarbon loss from mussel beds were equivocal, demonstrating that removal of oil from intertidal sediment is difficult. Exposure to residual oil may explain why some vertebrate populations (pigeon guillemots, Cepphus columba, and sea otters, Enhydra lutris) that forage in the most heavily impacted areas have not yet fully recovered from the spill.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

The vast majority of seabird monitoring in areas affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill has taken place around breeding colonies during the reproductive season, a time when food is generally at its most plentiful.  However, seabirds spend most of the year widely dispersed.  Late fall through winter are critical periods for survival as food tends to be relatively scarce or inaccessible, the climate more extreme, light levels reduced, day length shorter and water temperatures colder.  Post-spill ecosystem recovery and changing physical and biological factors all have the potential to affect Prince William Sound (PWS) seabird populations.  Of the seabirds that overwinter in PWS, nine species were initially injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, including three species that have not yet recovered (marbled murrelet, Kittlitzâs murrelet and pigeon guillemot).  From October 2011 through Decembe 2016, this project will monitor marine bird abundance, species composition, and habitat associations using multiple surveys (up to 5 surveys per season) during late fall and winter.  The data will improve our predictive models of marine bird species abundance and distribution in relation to biological and physical environmental factors.  In addition, by monitoring the top-down forcing by marine birds, a major source of herring predation, this project will complement the suite of PWS Herring Research & Monitoring studies, including improved mortality estimates for herring population models.  This project is part of the pelagic component within the integrated Gulfwatch program.  Our project uses as observing platforms the vessels associated with the Gulfwatch Humpback Whale surveys and PWS Herring Research & Monitoring Juvenile Herring Abundance Index as well as the Extended Adult Herring Biomass Surveys (year 2 onward) and integrates the marine bird observations with those studies.","Long-term monitoring of seabird abundance and habitat associations during late fall and winter in Prince William Sound","Mary Anne Bishop"

The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office).

In 1990, experimental studies began in Herring Bay, Knight Island, Prince William Sound, which were designed to compliment the overall monitoring program by experimentally assessing intertidal community dynamics and mechanisms of recovery. This experimental approach went beyond basic species inventories, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of the oil spill impacts on physical and biological interactions mediating community structure. The manipulative experiments were designed to evaluate the strength of important species interactions and the role of physical factors in community structure. 

Abstract: Intertidal studies established in 1990 in Herring Bay, Prince William Sound in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill continued through the 1995 field season. Examination of the dominant intertidal alga, Fucus gardneri, showed that in the high intertidal, reproductive plants had fewer receptacles per plant and egg settlement rates were lower at oiled than control sites. Fucus germlings were negatively affected by herbivores and desiccation. Excluding plants which lost thallus material, plants grew faster at oiled than control sites. Experiments employing biodegradable erosion control fabric mats to act as a substrate for Fucus germlings were initiated in 1993 on a sheltered rocky site which had been heavily oiled. Dense populations of Fucus had developed on the surface of the mats by the summer 1994. Populations of intertidal grazing invertebrates, such as limpets and periwinkles continued to show reduced densities on oiled sites in 1994. Results of comparisons of mussel size-frequency, filamentous algae abundance and mussel recruitment in filamentous algae on oiled and control sites showed a higher abundance of smaller and recruiting mussels and filamentous algae on oiled sites. These patterns appear to be related to the detection of higher water motion on oiled sites based on calcium sulphate cylinder dissolution rates.

In the current study, five pairs of intertidal stations, each composed of one oiled and one nearby unoiled station (as identified by concurrent National Marine Fisheries Service studies), were evaluated for potential ecological impacts due to subsurface lingering oil. Oiled sediments were not toxic in the larval mussel bioassay using Mytilusedulis galloprovincialis, where development and survival in the 100% elutriate were equivalent to the unoiled stations and the controls. Significant toxicity was observed in the 28âday amphipod bioassay using Leptocheirus plumulosus, where survival at the oiled stations was 0% while survival in the unoiled stations ranged from 37 to 84%. Survival was inversely related to sediment PAH and positively related to percent fines (p<0.05). However, decreased survival in the unoiled sediments suggests that this test may have been influenced by the predominance of very coarse sediments and a lack of fineâgrained sediments. Benthic community structure was found to be similar between most oiled and unoiled stations; however, the power of statistical tests was low due to replicate variability. Study results indicate that residual oil sequestered in intertidal sediments is not causing communityâwide effects though populations of sensitive species, such as amphipods, may be impaired.

Abstract: Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi) were captured in the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, Prince William Sound (PWS), and Kodiak Island during 1976-1999. Blood was collected from 286 seals. Sera were tested for evidence of exposure to Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1 (PhoHV-1), phocid herpesvirus-2 (PhHV-2), and phocine distemper virus (PDV). Antibody prevalence rates were 46% (46/100) for Brucella spp., 93% (225/243) for PhoHV-1, 0% (0/286) for PhHV-2, and 1% (2/160) for PDV. Antibody prevalence for Brucella spp. was directly related to host age. Antibody prevalence for PhoHV-1 was higher in PWS as compared to the other three regions. No evidence of mortality attributable to these four agents was observed during the course of this study. Based on the results of this survey, none of these agents is considered a significant mortality factor in harbor seals from the four regions of coastal Alaska included in the study.

Data indicated that LWC contained significant amounts of spawning habitat that were underutilized by pink and coho salmon due to an ineffective barrier bypass structure. The project priorities were to renovate the bypass to reduce gradients and design resting pools to minimize water velocity. The bypass renovation was completed in the fall 1995; bypass gradients were reduced from 27% to 17-20% and two additional resting pools and an entrance pool were installed. The steeppass sections were staggered between pools to reduce the velocity of stream flows. The historical performance of the three bypasses at LWC, since installation in 1981, has been significant, increasing average pink salmon escapements from -7,000 to -70,000 fish. The number of pink salmon migrating by way of all three bypasses to spawn in upstream habitat has significantly increased resultant returns; however, regression analysis was driven by the large upstream escapement in 1993. The historical proportion of the total annual pink salmon escapement to migrate upstream has primarily been a function of the design and performance of the largest (most upstream) bypass.

"103","df35d.336.6","urn:node:GOA","We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to localized declines of the black leather chiton, Katharina tunicata, on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.

Purpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.

Description of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. 

Abstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska.

Analyses of invertebrate and macroalgal groups showed that each core area and depth strata had unique descriptive genera/groups, however annual differences were not noted. Analyses also showed that intertidal communities differ in composition, biomass, and diversity than subtidal communities. Also, intertidal communities can not be used as an indicator for subtidal communities.

The general mission of this Natural Resource Damage Assessment floating oil mapping effort was to document the extent, amount and persistence of oil resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989. While the aerial overflight mapping effort has been reduced since mid May, to one flight a day from two or three, there are still regular aerial overflights being performed to monitor the location and extent of oil in the water. Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering. Other techniques are used to display the identified oil relative to regions of suspended sediment where the oil may have become sufficiently heavy to have become submerged.","Geographic Extent, Temporal Persistence and Mapping of Floating Oil from the the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill","Marshal Kendziorek"

In 1991, the project was reclassified as Subtidal Study Number 2 and renamed (Injury to Benthic Communities) and had distinct shallow tidal and deep tidal project objectives. In 1992, the two elements were split into separate project numbers 2A (Injury to Shallow Benthic Communities and 2B (Deep Water Benthos). 

This study was designed to assess the possible injury by petroleum, derived from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to benthic infaunal resources within Prince William Sound in water deeper than 20 m. The sampling plan was developed to coordinate with several other concurrent programs within Prince William Sound. Analyses of benthic biological data collected from 14 bays in Prince William Sound in 1990 at 40, 100 and > 100 m, by univariate and multivariate techniques, demonstrated no obvious disturbance effects on the benthic biota 16 months after the oil spill. In all multivariate analyses, the major environmental variables related to the composition of benthic assemblages were sediment parameters such as percent silt, clay, mud, percent water and amount of nitrogen and carbon in sediment. Although limited amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons and presence of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were detected at some sites at 40 and 100 m in 1989 and 1990, minor or no impact was sustained by benthic fauna of the deep benthos within the Sound. It is apparent that the current speed within Prince William Sound during the oil spill was sufficient to flush out toxic fractions of the oil spill before they could damage the fauna within the deep benthos.

We recorded 58 species of seabirds, which were dominated numerically by five species; species-richness was greatest in October and May and lowest in December and March. Abundance was greatest in May and October, in the winters of 1997-1998 and 1999-2000, and, depending on the species, at the shelf-break front or in the mid-shelf. The shelf-break front is highly important to the overwinter survival of a variety of bird and mammal species; the mid-shelf zone appears to be important to a suite of diving seabirds that concentrate on nekton, especially fishes. We recorded 10 species of marine mammals, which were dominated numerically by Dall's Porpoises; the seasonal pattern of species-richness was identical to that seen for seabirds. Abundance of Dall's Porpoises was greatest in the Alaska Coastal Current, whereas several other species were concentrated at the shelf-break or widespread. We conclude that an at-sea monitoring program can provide valuable information on wintering seabirds and recommend that a seabird monitoring component be added to the proposed Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring Program.

reproductive parameters were normal at 2 colonies we surveyed outside the trajectory.
The only indication of recovery since the spill was a slight increase in reproductive success at
monitored colonies in 1991. The most likely cause of reduced numbers of murres at cliffs
following the oil spill was direct mortality from the oil. Since breeding murres were
congregating near colonies at the time of the spill, most murres killed were probably
experienced breeders. We concluded that reduced densities and skewed age structures were

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995). The data collected from Kodiak Archipelago sockeye populations were included in these reports while publications focused solely upon Kodiak Island sockeye data with limited analyses have also been generated: Barrett et al. (1993a, 1993b); Swanton and Nelson (1995); Swanton et al. (1996). 

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Limnology in Kodiak Island lakes, Alaska: 1990 to 1996","Dana Schmidt"

ShoreZone is a coastal habitat mapping and classification system in which georeferenced aerial imagery is collected specifically for the interpretation and integration of geological and biological features of the intertidal zone and nearshore environment. Oblique low-altitude aerial video and digital still imagery of the coastal zone is collected during summer low tides (zero tide level or lower), usually from a helicopter flying at <100 m altitude. The flight trackline is recorded at 1-second intervals using electronic navigation software and is continuously monitored in-flight to ensure all shorelines have been imaged. Video and still imagery collected are georeferenced and time-synchronized. Video imagery is accompanied by continuous, simultaneous commentary by a geologist and a biologist aboard the aircraft. The imagery and commentary are later used in the definition of discrete along-shore coastal habitat units and the ""mapping"" of observed physical, geomorphic, sedimentary, and biological features in those units.

Phase I was conducted in summer 1989/spring 1990 and involved site selection/ground truthing. Phase II involved intensive evaluation of study sites to determine extent of injury to natural resources in supratidal, intertidal and subtidal areas. Phase II commenced in the fall of 1989 and continued through the summer of 1991. The supratidal component was completed in 1991 and a final report was submitted separately. The subtidal portion was integrated into a suite of other subtidal studies and findings were also reported separately. Draft preliminary status reports were issued for the intertidal componenet in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 by Highsmith et al. as Coastal Habitat Study No. 1: Phase II in 1990 and 1991 and No. 1A in 1992 and 1993.

Abstract: The Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment Study was initiated to assess injury to intertidal habitats impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The study, conducted from 1989-1991, encompassed three major geographical areas impacted by the spill: Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet-Kenia Peninsula and Kodiak-Alaska Peninsula. Oiled sites were selected randomly and matched with non-oiled sites and classified into sheltered rocky, exposed rocky, coarse textured or estuarine habitat. Statistically significant differences between oiled and non-oiled sites were interpreted as impact due to the spill and/or clean-up activities. Most observed differences varied across regions, habitats and tidal heights. Algae, especially the perennial Fucus, was generally negatively impacted on oiled sites. Conversely, an increase in annual and ephemeral species in the lower intertidal occurred. Limpets, mussels, littorines, and the high cockscomb prickleback were injured by the spill, while oligochaetes and a single barnacle species were enhanced at most tidal heights following the spill. Although intertidal communities showed widespread impact from oiling/clean-up activities for algal, invertebrate and fish components, data revealed most habitats were recovering but had fully recovered by 1991.

"121","df35d.351.11","urn:node:GOA","Study History: Following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Coghill Lake was selected as a system for sockeye salmon restoration to replace fishery stocks damaged by the oil spill. Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. 

Abstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage by sampling various treated and untreated sites in 2002. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

The vast majority of seabird monitoring in areas affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill has taken place around breeding colonies during the reproductive season, a time when food is generally at its most plentiful.  However, seabirds spend most of the year widely dispersed.  Late fall through winter are critical periods for survival as food tends to be relatively scarce or inaccessible, the climate more extreme, light levels reduced, day length shorter and water temperatures colder.  Post-spill ecosystem recovery and changing physical and biological factors all have the potential to affect Prince William Sound (PWS) seabird populations.  Of the seabirds that overwinter in PWS, nine species were initially injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, including three species that have not yet recovered (marbled murrelet, Kittlitzâs murrelet and pigeon guillemot).  From October 2011 through Decembe 2016, this project will monitor marine bird abundance, species composition, and habitat associations using multiple surveys (up to 5 surveys per season) during late fall and winter.  The data will improve our predictive models of marine bird species abundance and distribution in relation to biological and physical environmental factors.  In addition, by monitoring the top-down forcing by marine birds, a major source of herring predation, this project will complement the suite of PWS Herring Research & Monitoring studies, including improved mortality estimates for herring population models.  This project is part of the pelagic component within the integrated Gulfwatch program.  Our project uses as observing platforms the vessels associated with the Gulfwatch Humpback Whale surveys and PWS Herring Research & Monitoring Juvenile Herring Abundance Index as well as the Extended Adult Herring Biomass Surveys (year 2 onward) and integrates the marine bird observations with those studies.","Long-term monitoring of seabird abundance and habitat associations during late fall and winter in Prince William Sound","Mary Anne Bishop"

"126","df35i.17.6","urn:node:GOA","Subsistence users from the remote Alaska Peninsula Native Village of Perryville had noted significant declines in the coho salmon run in the nearby Kametolook River since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The Trustee Council began funding a project in Federal Fiscal Year 1997 (October 1, 1996 - September 30, 1997) with the intent of restoring this coho salmon run. This project was a continuation of an evaluative phase of the project funded through the EVOS criminal settlement (Grant Agreement Number 21685881 May through September 1996). The criminal settlement funded the project for an assessment team from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) and local assistants from the Native Village of Perryville. The assessment period determined the preferred method to restore the Kametolook River's coho salmon run to historic levels. This phase ended with the approval of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in May 1997. The EA and project review supported instream incubation boxes as the preferred restoration alternative.

Annually, every November 1997 through 2001, coho salmon eggs were placed in two Kametolook River instream incubation boxes to improve the green egg to fry survival over natural in-river conditions. Since, 1997, the Kametolook River coho escapement has shown some improvement. The later coho salmon escapement level can also be partially attributed to self-imposed in-river harvest restrictions by the villagers and commercial fishing restrictions in marine waters. Community involvement and use of local traditional ecological knowledge by the villagers of Perryville was also an integral part of the projects plan toward the restoration of Kametolook River coho salmon as a subsistence resource. Kametolook River coho escapement estimates didn't increase significantly over the six years of the project as hoped. This is due in part to the low number of annual returning adult coho salmon available for the egg takes and natural spawning.

In 1999, The Perryville Subsistence Workgroup was formed to address the subsistence needs of Perryville residents and has remained active throughout the remainder of this project. This group is currently seeking funding that will allow the egg box project to continue beyond September 2002. In addition, this group also hopes to obtain genetic and pathology samples of nearby coho systems (fish transport permit requirements) and the eventual transport of eggs from these systems to the Kametolook River egg boxes. This additional work should increase escapements in the Kametolook River and thus provide more eggs for the incubation boxes and eventually a surplus of adult coho salmon available for Perryville residents' subsistence fishing.

Also as part of the project, starting in 1996 a school aquarium project for the Perryville School was set up and maintained annually throughout all project years. Annually approximately 300 to 500 fertilized coho salmon eggs were placed in the Perryville school aquarium and students followed the development of the eggs to the swim up fry stage. The teachers developed lesson plans in biology and ecology around the aquarium project and developed a stewardship of the local salmon runs with the students.","Kametolook River Coho Salmon Subsistence Project, Perryville, Alaska (1997 - 2002).","Lisa Hutchinson-Scarbrough"

Abstract: Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi) were captured in the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, Prince William Sound (PWS), and Kodiak Island during 1976-1999. Blood was collected from 286 seals. Sera were tested for evidence of exposure to Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1 (PhoHV-1), phocid herpesvirus-2 (PhHV-2), and phocine distemper virus (PDV). Antibody prevalence rates were 46% (46/100) for Brucella spp., 93% (225/243) for PhoHV-1, 0% (0/286) for PhHV-2, and 1% (2/160) for PDV. Antibody prevalence for Brucella spp. was directly related to host age. Antibody prevalence for PhoHV-1 was higher in PWS as compared to the other three regions. No evidence of mortality attributable to these four agents was observed during the course of this study. Based on the results of this survey, none of these agents is considered a significant mortality factor in harbor seals from the four regions of coastal Alaska included in the study.

The general mission of this Natural Resource Damage Assessment floating oil mapping effort was to document the extent, amount and persistence of oil resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989. While the aerial overflight mapping effort has been reduced since mid May, to one flight a day from two or three, there are still regular aerial overflights being performed to monitor the location and extent of oil in the water. Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering. Other techniques are used to display the identified oil relative to regions of suspended sediment where the oil may have become sufficiently heavy to have become submerged.","Geographic Extent, Temporal Persistence and Mapping of Floating Oil from the the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: 1989","Marshal Kendziorek"

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Subsequently, annual reports were submitted entitled Habitat Use, Behavior, and Monitoring of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound: 1994 Annual Report, 1995 Annual Report, 1996 Annual Report , 1997 Annual Report, 1998 Annual Report, and 1999 Annual Report .

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

Adult salmon will begin returning in 1996 and 1997, with larger numbers projected at nearly 1,000 adult fish, returning in 1998 and thereafter.

Studv History: 50,000 chinook salmon smolt were released in the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996 at Crab Bay on Evans Island, Prince William Sound as part of an ongoing Trustee Council program to replace injured subsistence resources and services (Restoration Projects 94272,95272 and 96272). Chinook salmon return varying between adult ages of 4 and 7 years. A few adults are anticipated to begin returning in 1996, with nearly 1,000 returning in 1998 as the age classes build and releases continue. Chinook salmon returning to Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation's Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (WNH) at Esther Island were harvested as brood stock. Eggs were taken and incubated at the hatchery and the resultant fry reared for an additional year to smolt size. 50,000 smolt were released at Crab Bay. This annual cycle will continue through 1998.

ShoreZone is a coastal habitat mapping and classification system in which georeferenced aerial imagery is collected specifically for the interpretation and integration of geological and biological features of the intertidal zone and nearshore environment. Oblique low-altitude aerial video and digital still imagery of the coastal zone is collected during summer low tides (zero tide level or lower), usually from a helicopter flying at <100 m altitude. The flight trackline is recorded at 1-second intervals using electronic navigation software and is continuously monitored in-flight to ensure all shorelines have been imaged. Video and still imagery collected are georeferenced and time-synchronized. Video imagery is accompanied by continuous, simultaneous commentary by a geologist and a biologist aboard the aircraft. The imagery and commentary are later used in the definition of discrete along-shore coastal habitat units and the âmappingâ of observed physical, geomorphic, sedimentary, and biological features in those units.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

"139","df35d.7.12","urn:node:GOA","Study History: 
After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, many researchers began measuring hydrocarbon concentrations in mussels, sediment, and other matrices in Prince William Sound to assess resource damage. The specific focus of this project was dense aggregations of intertidal mussels (Mytilus trossulus) within the slick trajectory. Oil accumulated in these filter-feeders; total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were high in 1989 and remained relatively high for several years in mussel beds on unconsolidated sediment. The persistence of oil in these beds in Prince William Sound and along the Gulf of Alaska caused concern, and beginning in 1992 heavily oiled beds were systematically surveyed for oil content in mussel tissue and underlying sediment. Projections from earlier data (through 1995) were that oil would persist for up to three decades, thus funding for study was extended through 1999. This report synthesizes all available natural resource damage assessment data (17 independent studies) to develop a coherent picture of spatial and temporal oil distributions in mussels and sediment.

Abstract: 
Exxon Valdez oil trapped in intertidal sediment in Prince William Sound degraded slowly, was biologically available for at least a decade, and was toxic for at least 9 years. Habitat condition controlled the biological availability of oil. Exposure duration was short where mussels were only exposed to oil in water (months) and long (6 to 10 years) at locations where oil remained in sediment. Limited evidence suggests some oiling extended outside previously reported slick boundaries; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sources were verified with three independent petrogenic composition models. After an initial peak, oil concentrations typically declined in sediment and mussels, although distribution was non-uniform and variability was often high. Oil may persist in some intertidal sediment for >50 years, but declines in mussel tissue suggest it became less available to surface organisms and this community is recovering. Attempts to manually accelerate hydrocarbon loss from mussel beds were equivocal, demonstrating that removal of oil from intertidal sediment is difficult. Exposure to residual oil may explain why some vertebrate populations (pigeon guillemots, Cepphus columba, and sea otters, Enhydra lutris) that forage in the most heavily impacted areas have not yet fully recovered from the spill.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Edmundson et al. (1992) suggested that a decrease in macrozooplankton from excessive foraging by high densities of rearing fry produced from large escapements caused the decline in returns of Coghill Lake sockeye salmon. In 1993, a planned 5-year nutrient enrichment and evaluation continued in 1994 (Restoration Project 94259), 1995 (Restoration Project 95259) and 1996 (Restoration Project 96259). The fifth year of nutrient enrichment (1997) was not funded and this report summarizes results from the 4 years of treatment. 

Abstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska.

This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon.

The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project.

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.

In 1991, the project was reclassified as Subtidal Study Number 2 and renamed (Injury to Benthic Communities) and had distinct shallow tidal and deep tidal project objectives. In 1992, the two elements were split into separate project numbers 2A (Injury to Shallow Benthic Communities and 2B (Deep Water Benthos). 

This study was designed to assess the possible injury by petroleum, derived from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to benthic infaunal resources within Prince William Sound in water deeper than 20 m. The sampling plan was developed to coordinate with several other concurrent programs within Prince William Sound. Analyses of benthic biological data collected from 14 bays in Prince William Sound in 1990 at 40, 100 and > 100 m, by univariate and multivariate techniques, demonstrated no obvious disturbance effects on the benthic biota 16 months after the oil spill. In all multivariate analyses, the major environmental variables related to the composition of benthic assemblages were sediment parameters such as percent silt, clay, mud, percent water and amount of nitrogen and carbon in sediment. Although limited amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons and presence of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were detected at some sites at 40 and 100 m in 1989 and 1990, minor or no impact was sustained by benthic fauna of the deep benthos within the Sound. It is apparent that the current speed within Prince William Sound during the oil spill was sufficient to flush out toxic fractions of the oil spill before they could damage the fauna within the deep benthos.

Forage fish were collected monthly in western PWS with purse seines in 1994 and in three regions of PWS (southwestern, central and northeastern) with a mid-water trawl in 1995 (summer and autumn) and with a beach seine in 1996 (summer). The species examined were mainly young-of-the-year (YOY) and age 1 walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific herring (Clupeu pallasi), Pacific sandlance (Ammodytes hexapterus), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum salmon (O. keta), sockeye salmon (O. nerka), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific tomcod (Microgadus proximus), prowfish (Zaprora silenus), northern smoothtongue (Leuroglossus schmidti), eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and Pacific sandfish (Trichodon trichodon). We compared seasonal size, diet composition and diet overlap between species from May-November, 1994; described the diets, prey fields and prey selection of juvenile pollock and herring in summer and autumn, 1995 and of juvenile herring, sandlance and pink salmon in summer, 1996; examined for prey shifts and feeding declines when the 1995-96 fish occurred in multi-species aggregations (sympatrically) compared to when they occurred in single species aggregations (allopatrically) to test for competition; and compared diet composition interannually for several species in July of the three years.

Sampling water from the sea chest of the ship at 4m, the underway system measured: (1) temperature and salinity: basic physical variables, (2) nitrate: an essential phytoplankton nutrient, (3) chlorophyll fluorescence: an indicator of phytoplankton concentration, (4) colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence: an indicator of terrestrial runoff, and (5) optical beam transmittance: an indicator of suspended sediment. The measurements show large spatial variability at short time scales, but spatially coherent climate change over annual time scales. Governed by snow and ice melt, the ocean climate transitioned from a warm, fresh regime in 2004-2005 to a cold, salty regime in 2007-2008. Agreement with observations at the GAK1 monitoring site near Seward, AK, extends their applicability to the northern Gulf of Alaskas continental shelf. Nitrate and chlorophyll measurements show nutrient-rich periods lead to increased phytoplankton. A computer monitor displayed the water temperature along the route and mapped the progress of the ferry. The successful measurement program and connections to long-term climate change demonstrate the utility of oceanographic measurements from ferryboats.

"148","df35b.114.6","urn:node:GOA","Harlequin ducks have been studied extensively in Prince William Sound during the restoration phase following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, leading to one of the most thorough considerations of wildlife population injury and recovery following a major oil spill ever undertaken. These efforts have included population monitoring by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as a series of directed research projects designed to elucidate the process of, and constraints to, population recovery. These studies demonstrated that harlequin ducks were exposed to lingering oil over a much longer time frame (i.e., through at least 2005, 16 years following the spill) than expected at the time of the spill, based on elevated levels of cytochrome P4501A induction in birds from oiled areas. In addition, several lines of evidence suggested that population injury occurred through at least 1998. Specifically, female winter survival probabilities were found to differ between oiled and unoiled areas, and densities were shown to be lower in oiled than unoiled areas after accounting for habitat-related effects. More recent data have indicated that female winter survival did not differ between oiled and unoiled sites during 2000-03, suggesting that direct effects of oil exposure on demographic properties may have abated.
In response to the data described above, the work here was proposed to add to the existing cytochrome P4501A monitoring data to track the timeline of exposure to lingering oil, and to assemble the demographic data collected during previous restoration studies into a quantitative population model to allow consideration of the timing and magnitude of oil spill injury, the mechanisms by which injury occurred and population recovery was constrained, and the current status of recovery, including predictions for timing of full recovery.

 FINDINGS: We found that cytochrome P4501A induction during winters 2005, 2006-07, and 2009 was higher in harlequin ducks captured in areas of Prince William Sound oiled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, relative to unoiled areas. Cytochrome P4501A induction did not vary in relation to age, sex, or mass of individuals, nor did it vary strongly by season in samples collected early and late in the winter. We interpret these results to indicate that harlequin ducks continued to be exposed to residual Exxon Valdez oil up to 20 years after the original spill. Population modeling efforts indicated that female mortality related to chronic exposure to lingering oil was nearly double that estimated during the acute phase (the weeks and months immediately post-spill). Full recovery to pre-spill numbers was estimated to require between 13 and 32 years, with the most likely recovery scenario requiring roughly 24 years. Taken together, the data presented in this report add to a growing body of literature suggesting that effects of oil spills on wildlife have the potential to be expressed over much longer time frames than previously assumed.

However, we know little about the relative value of MDN compared to other nutrient and carbon sources (e.g., watershed-derived) in the Gulf of Alaska region. The objectives of this study were to develop a water chemistry proxy for monitoring salmon returns, and to track and measure MDN effects in stream, riparian and nearshore environments, on the southern Kenai Peninsula. We show that stable isotopes and fatty acids were both effective indicators of MDN assimilation in stream resident fishes. Our water nutrient profiles suggest rapid nitrogen (N) uptake in Homer streams, which have underlying phosphorous (P) rich geology. Stable isotopes were most effective when the salmon-free end member was relatively depleted. Marine-derived nitrogen (deltaN15) was highly variable, likely due to spatial variation in N sources and cycling, and may not be a reliable predictor of MDN inputs at the watershed scale. Fatty acids were most effective when quantified as ω3:ω6. Based on our data the development of a nutrient proxy for estimating salmon escapement shows some promise in certain situations, but is unlikely in the majority of salmon streams in southcentral Alaska.

"152","df35d.344.5","urn:node:GOA","We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to localized declines of the black leather chiton, Katharina tunicata, on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

The general mission of this Natural Resource Damage Assessment floating oil mapping effort was to document the extent, amount and persistence of oil resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989. While the aerial overflight mapping effort has been reduced since mid May, to one flight a day from two or three, there are still regular aerial overflights being performed to monitor the location and extent of oil in the water. Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering. Other techniques are used to display the identified oil relative to regions of suspended sediment where the oil may have become sufficiently heavy to have become submerged.","Geographic Extent, Temporal Persistence and Mapping of Floating Oil from the the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: 1989","Marshal Kendziorek"

Multi-frequency acoustic/net sampling assessments of the pink salmon food supply and predators were conducted in Prince William Sound during spring 2001. Five cruises were completed between April 18 and June 15, 2001. The results of this monitoring were in sharp contrast with observations from the previous year. Overall the abundance of large copepods (primarily Neocalanus) was much lower in 2001. The abundance was highest at the beginning of the monitoring in mid-April, but progressively declined rather than increased as was seen in 2000. Highest biomasses were observed above the deep hole adjacent to Naked Island, and the lowest biomass within protected bays, including the locations of Esther and Main Bay hatcheries. The pattern of fish abundance and distribution was generally similar both years. Highest fish abundance was in the main basin and relatively deep. Abundance in the pink salmon out-migration corridor increased slightly over the spring, but was low overall. However, fish in the out-migration corridor showed strong near-shore orientation in 2001, a pattern not seen in 2000. The results of this monitoring should provide valuable insights into the complex environmental conditions that govern juvenile salmon survival. Such information is becoming more important as Alaska's salmon hatchery programs come under increasing scrutiny.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989.

Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering.

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995).

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Smolt age, weight and length (1990-1997) and sockeye salmon escapement (1983-1993) in Kodiak Island lakes, Alaska","Dana Schmidt"

Specifically we will estimate the number of whales foraging in winter, determine when and if there is a prey switch to herring, and how long whales focus on herring as prey. Year one was funded, small in scale with an intense monitoring strategy; year 2 would expand the scale up in area significantly. Year 3 will verify the impact on herring of the high numbers of humpback whales we observed in PWS during year 2. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed (and energy content consumed). Lastly, the estimated numbers of herring consumed would be included in an age-structured model so that the significance of whale predation on herring recovery can be evaluated.

Abstract: Prior to the recent run decline, Coghill Lake consistently produced the highest runs of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Prince William Sound. Although limnological and juvenile fisheries data are not available before the run decline, it is believed that sockeye salmon fry produced from consecutive years of high escapements overgrazed the forage base (zooplankton) and reduced the lake's rearing capacity. In 1993, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council approved a stock restoration project (nutrient enrichment) for Coghill Lake as mitigation for damaged fishery resources. During 4 years of nutrient enrichment (1993 to 1996), the seasonal mean phosphorous concentration increased 220 percent, and the standing stock (density) of the prevalent zooplankton (Cyclops) increased 117 percent compared to pre-enrichment years. The sockeye salmon smolt population abundance averaged 263,604 before enrichment compared to 940,411 during treatment. This increased smolt production is attributed to increases in primary and secondary production because the number of smolts produced per spawner also increased during enrichment. The trophic level responses to nutrient enrichment in this meromictic, glacial were similar to those observed for other holomictic and meromictic (clear-water) lakes treated in Alaska.

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995). The data collected from Kodiak Archipelago sockeye populations were included in these reports while publications focused solely upon Kodiak Island sockeye data with limited analyses have also been generated: Barrett et al. (1993a, 1993b); Swanton and Nelson (1995); Swanton et al. (1996). 

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Sockeye Salmon Overescapement: Smolt Age, Weight and Length (1990-1997) and Sockeye Escapement (1983-1993) in Kodiak Island Lakes, Alaska","Dana Schmidt"
"173","df35b.118.4","urn:node:GOA","CYP1A has been used widely as an indicator of exposure of vertebrates to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the use of EROD activity as a measure of CYP1A has been validated and accepted as a standard method. EROD activity has been used since 1998 as an indicator of the degree of exposure of harlequin ducks to residual Exxon Valdez oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska. These data have proven to be extremely valuable for understanding the processes by which population recovery of harlequin ducks has been constrained following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. EROD activity data were collected in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2005 from wintering harlequin ducks captured in Prince William Sound; one reason for collecting these data was to provide a time series with which changes in exposure could be tracked over years. However, the data reported from the laboratory varied dramatically in magnitude from year to year, to a degree far beyond what could be expected due to normal biological variation. Similar variation was observed across years in harlequin ducks held at the Alaska SeaLife Center under strictly controlled circumstances. Therefore, this project was initiated to determine the explanation for this interannual variation, and to apply laboratory analyses and data standardization to allow valid interannual comparisons. Additional data analysis of EROD activity of wintering harlequin ducks captured in Prince William Sound in 2005 through 2007 confirmed that individual attributes (age, sex, and mass) and season of capture did not explain observed variation in EROD activity. In review of the originally reported EROD values, it was discovered that some data were reported in incorrect units. However, even after these were corrected, the large interannual discrepancies were not completely resolved. Other potential factors, such as low protein yields, were considered; exclusion of samples with low protein values, along with application of appropriate units, considerably reduced interannual variation, although differences were still apparent that reduced confidence in interannual comparisons. EROD reanalysis of old samples resulted in data that were correlated (R2 = 0.53) with original data, but values were considerably different in magnitude, possibly as a result of sample degradation or annually varying lab techniques or equipment. Also, not all individuals had adequate sample volume remaining for reanalysis, reducing the power for detecting differences across areas and years if only reanalyzed data were used. In consultation with the laboratory, it was concluded that changes in analysis approaches and equipment may have led to the observed interannual differences and that, although within-year comparisons between areas were valid, between-year comparisons were not appropriate without corrections. Therefore, a method indexing CYP1A values was created that allows for interannual contrasts, in which average EROD activity for harlequin ducks captured at our unoiled/control area (Montague Island) is set to 1 for each year and all values are adjusted accordingly within
the same sample year. Therefore, for each year, the average indexed EROD activity for
birds from oiled areas is a ratio of oiled to unoiled averages. The average indexed values
can be compared across years to consider annual changes in oil exposure, under the
assumption that oil exposure at unoiled Montague Island was the same across years.
Further, the indexed values can be calculated for each individual, which allows
consideration of relationships between individual variation in oil exposure and variation
in survival.","Quantifying Temporal Variation in Harlequin Duck Cytochrome P4501A Induction, Prince William Sound, Alaska  (1998-2002) - [UNFORMATTED]","Dan Esler"

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office). The United States Forest Service (Dirk Lang) also loaned a portable PIT tag reader.","Management applications: Implementing the SEA Pink Salmon Survival Model - Tagging technology: 2005","Steve Moffitt"
"176","df35d.231.5","urn:node:GOA","In 2001, Short et al. (2004) identified residual oil from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in intertidal sediments. In the current study, five pairs of intertidal stations, each composed of one oiled and one nearby unoiled station (as identified by concurrent National Marine Fisheries Service studies), were evaluated for potential ecological impacts due to subsurface lingering oil. Oiled sediments were not toxic in the larval mussel bioassay using Mytilusedulis galloprovincialis, where development and survival in the 100% elutriate were equivalent to the unoiled stations and the controls. Significant toxicity was observed in the 28-day amphipod bioassay using Leptocheirus plumulosus, where survival at the oiled stations was 0% while survival in the unoiled stations ranged from 37 to 84%. Survival was inversely related to sediment PAH and positively related to percent fines (p<0.05). However, decreased survival in the unoiled sediments suggests that this test may have been influenced by the predominance of very coarse sediments and a lack of fine-grained sediments. Benthic community structure was found to be similar between most oiled and unoiled stations; however, the power of statistical tests was low due to replicate variability. Study results indicate that residual oil sequestered in intertidal sediments is not causing community-wide effects though populations of sensitive species, such as amphipods, may be impaired.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

"181","df35d.252.4","urn:node:GOA","Study History: The purpose of this study was to characterize the basic ecology, distribution, and demographics of sand lance in lower Cook Inlet. Recent declines of upper trophic level species in the northern Gulf of Alaska have been linked to decreasing availability of forage fishes. Sand lance is the most important forage fish in most nearshore areas of the northern Gulf. Despite its importance to commercial fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, little is known or published on the basic biology of this key prey species. Therefore, restoration project /306 was established to work in coordination with restoration APEX project /163M to help characterize the relationship between seabird population dynamics and forage fish abundance. 

Abstract: Distinct sand lance populations occur within the relatively small geographic area of Lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. Marked meso-scale differences in abundance, growth, and mortality exist as a consequence of differing oceanographic regimes. Growth rate within populations (between years) was positively correlated with temperature. However, this did not extend to inter-population comparisons where differing growth rates were better correlated to marine productivity. Most sand lance reached maturity in their second year. Field observations and indices of maturity, gonad development, and ova-size distribution all indicated that sand lance spawn once each year. Sand lance spawned intertidally in late September and October on fine gravel/sandy beaches. Embryos developed over 67 days through periods of intertidal exposure and sub-freezing air temperatures. Mean dry-weight energy value of sand lance cycles seasonally, peaking in spring and early summer, and subsequently declining by about 25% during late summer and fall. Sand lance enter the winter with close to their minimum whole body energy content.

"184","df35d.342.4","urn:node:GOA","We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to localized declines of the black leather chiton, Katharina tunicata, on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

"185","df35d.7.11","urn:node:GOA","Study History: 
After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, many researchers began measuring hydrocarbon concentrations in mussels, sediment, and other matrices in Prince William Sound to assess resource damage. The specific focus of this project was dense aggregations of intertidal mussels (Mytilus trossulus) within the slick trajectory. Oil accumulated in these filter-feeders; total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were high in 1989 and remained relatively high for several years in mussel beds on unconsolidated sediment. The persistence of oil in these beds in Prince William Sound and along the Gulf of Alaska caused concern, and beginning in 1992 heavily oiled beds were systematically surveyed for oil content in mussel tissue and underlying sediment. Projections from earlier data (through 1995) were that oil would persist for up to three decades, thus funding for study was extended through 1999. This report synthesizes all available natural resource damage assessment data (17 independent studies) to develop a coherent picture of spatial and temporal oil distributions in mussels and sediment.

Abstract: 
Exxon Valdez oil trapped in intertidal sediment in Prince William Sound degraded slowly, was biologically available for at least a decade, and was toxic for at least 9 years. Habitat condition controlled the biological availability of oil. Exposure duration was short where mussels were only exposed to oil in water (months) and long (6 to 10 years) at locations where oil remained in sediment. Limited evidence suggests some oiling extended outside previously reported slick boundaries; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sources were verified with three independent petrogenic composition models. After an initial peak, oil concentrations typically declined in sediment and mussels, although distribution was non-uniform and variability was often high. Oil may persist in some intertidal sediment for >50 years, but declines in mussel tissue suggest it became less available to surface organisms and this community is recovering. Attempts to manually accelerate hydrocarbon loss from mussel beds were equivocal, demonstrating that removal of oil from intertidal sediment is difficult. Exposure to residual oil may explain why some vertebrate populations (pigeon guillemots, Cepphus columba, and sea otters, Enhydra lutris) that forage in the most heavily impacted areas have not yet fully recovered from the spill.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

In 1991, the project was reclassified as Subtidal Study Number 2 and renamed (Injury to Benthic Communities) and had distinct shallow tidal and deep tidal project objectives. In 1992, the two elements were split into separate project numbers 2A (Injury to Shallow Benthic Communities and 2B (Deep Water Benthos). 

This study was designed to assess the possible injury by petroleum, derived from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to benthic infaunal resources within Prince William Sound in water deeper than 20 m. The sampling plan was developed to coordinate with several other concurrent programs within Prince William Sound. Analyses of benthic biological data collected from 14 bays in Prince William Sound in 1990 at 40, 100 and > 100 m, by univariate and multivariate techniques, demonstrated no obvious disturbance effects on the benthic biota 16 months after the oil spill. In all multivariate analyses, the major environmental variables related to the composition of benthic assemblages were sediment parameters such as percent silt, clay, mud, percent water and amount of nitrogen and carbon in sediment. Although limited amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons and presence of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were detected at some sites at 40 and 100 m in 1989 and 1990, minor or no impact was sustained by benthic fauna of the deep benthos within the Sound. It is apparent that the current speed within Prince William Sound during the oil spill was sufficient to flush out toxic fractions of the oil spill before they could damage the fauna within the deep benthos.

Between 23 June and 4 September Pratt Museum and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff worked in the museum with the cameras as public interpreters and data collectors. They helped teach nearly 15,000 visitors about seabirds, predator-prey relationships, habitat, and scientific research. Productivity data for a selected study plot was collected by camera at the museum and by observers in the field using binoculars and telescopes. Comparison of data sets revealed variations between data from camera and field observations. With camera observation fewer murres were counted, adult postures more frequently misidentified, eggs and chicks less frequently seen, and different hatch dates recorded. Calculated results for measures of
productivity were similar between the two methods, however. Public interaction with interpreter/data collectors greatly enhanced education and outreach but may have been one factor responsible for variation between camera-derived and field-derived data. Electronic interference, problems of hardware/software design, and delayed field maintenance were among other factors influencing camera effectiveness. These data include raw counts only and do not include vistitor participation data.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

ShoreZone is a coastal habitat mapping and classification system in which georeferenced aerial imagery is collected specifically for the interpretation and integration of geological and biological features of the intertidal zone and nearshore environment. Oblique low-altitude aerial video and digital still imagery of the coastal zone is collected during summer low tides (zero tide level or lower), usually from a helicopter flying at <100 m altitude. The flight trackline is recorded at 1-second intervals using electronic navigation software and is continuously monitored in-flight to ensure all shorelines have been imaged. Video and still imagery collected are georeferenced and time-synchronized. Video imagery is accompanied by continuous, simultaneous commentary by a geologist and a biologist aboard the aircraft. The imagery and commentary are later used in the definition of discrete along-shore coastal habitat units and the âmappingâ of observed physical, geomorphic, sedimentary, and biological features in those units.

The general mission of this Natural Resource Damage Assessment floating oil mapping effort was to document the extent, amount and persistence of oil resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989. While the aerial overflight mapping effort has been reduced since mid May, to one flight a day from two or three, there are still regular aerial overflights being performed to monitor the location and extent of oil in the water. Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering. Other techniques are used to display the identified oil relative to regions of suspended sediment where the oil may have become sufficiently heavy to have become submerged.","Geographic Extent, Temporal Persistence and Mapping of Floating Oil from the the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: 1989","Marshal Kendziorek"

The acquisition of private lands, or partial interests in private lands, is intended to promote natural recovery of spill-injured resources and services by removing the threat of additional development impacts. These lands will be managed in perpetuity for the restoration and protection of resources and services injured by the spill and for the enjoyment of the public for purposes of subsistence use, sport fishing and hunting, personal use fishing, trapping, recreational uses and commercial fishing.

The Comprehensive Habitat Protection Process is the method that was designed to achieve this objective. During the Large Parcel Process, over one million acres within the oil spill affected area were evaluated, scored, and ranked by a multi-cri- teria evaluation process. Initially lands were divided into large parcels encompass- ing entire bays and watersheds. Criteria were used to assess the habitat and human use values associated with each parcel and the protection benefit that acquisition would provide for 19 injured resources and associated services. This process pro- vided the basis for the acquisition of protective bundles of rights on over 637,000 acres of land in the Kodiak, Kenai Peninsula, and Prince William Sound regions.

During the Small Parcel Process, smaller parcels, those less than 1,000 acres nominated by willing sellers, were also evaluated using criteria modified to reflect the unique benefits to injured resources that smaller parcels could provide in relation to the surrounding environment, management units and local communities. Over 9,000 acres were protected through this process.","Habitat protection and acquisition support for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council in Alaska: 1993 - 2004",NA

Monitoring was continued in 1995-2011 as part of the EVOS Trustee Council restoration program. The North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) independently maintained a monitoring program in all other years since 1984. The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales. Vital rates for AB pod and all other frequently sighted resident pods have been calculated annually based on the photographic data.","Comprehensive Killer Whale Investigation: Annual Photographic Survey Summaries in Alaska 1984 - 2011","Craig Matkin"

In 1991, the project was reclassified as Subtidal Study Number 2 and renamed (Injury to Benthic Communities) and had distinct shallow tidal and deep tidal project objectives. In 1992, the two elements were split into separate project numbers 2A (Injury to Shallow Benthic Communities and 2B (Deep Water Benthos). 

This study was designed to assess the possible injury by petroleum, derived from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to benthic infaunal resources within Prince William Sound in water deeper than 20 m. The sampling plan was developed to coordinate with several other concurrent programs within Prince William Sound. Analyses of benthic biological data collected from 14 bays in Prince William Sound in 1990 at 40, 100 and > 100 m, by univariate and multivariate techniques, demonstrated no obvious disturbance effects on the benthic biota 16 months after the oil spill. In all multivariate analyses, the major environmental variables related to the composition of benthic assemblages were sediment parameters such as percent silt, clay, mud, percent water and amount of nitrogen and carbon in sediment. Although limited amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons and presence of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were detected at some sites at 40 and 100 m in 1989 and 1990, minor or no impact was sustained by benthic fauna of the deep benthos within the Sound. It is apparent that the current speed within Prince William Sound during the oil spill was sufficient to flush out toxic fractions of the oil spill before they could damage the fauna within the deep benthos.

Earlier studies stated that there are only a few streams in Prince William Sound with these species, but after consultation with local residents, it appeared these fish were more widespread than previously believed. Given these uncertainties, we consulted local residents, government agencies, Native groups, and other knowledgeable individuals to determine where these species could be found. Streams and lake systems were surveyed by field crews to determine the presence or absence of these species. We found 29 lakes and streams which had undocumented populations of these and other anadromous fish species. The number of undocumented populations by species were as follows: 23 Dolly Varden, 21 cutthroat trout, 14 coho salmon (O. kisutch), two sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and one chum salmon (O. keta). Six resident Dolly Varden and six resident cutthroat trout populations were also identified. The results of this study are being used to update the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, or Migration of Anadromous Fishes, (Anadromous Waters Catalog) and assist the research being conducted under EVOS project 96145.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.

Purpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Service's Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.

Description of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format: Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008. Paper records of counts, vessel Other data sets pertainin to weather, lunar cycles, tidal cycles and related environmental data have been compiled from other sources for analysis.

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995). The data collected from Kodiak Archipelago sockeye populations were included in these reports while publications focused solely upon Kodiak Island sockeye data with limited analyses have also been generated: Barrett et al. (1993a, 1993b); Swanton and Nelson (1995); Swanton et al. (1996). 

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Zooplanton sampling in Kodiak Island lakes, Alaska: 1990 to 1996","Dana Schmidt"

Herring were collected during March-July 2005-2007 and November 2007 from focal spawning locations in Sitka Sound (two locations, total n = 300), PWS (two locations, total n = 221), Kamishak Bay (two locations, total n = 300), Kodiak Island (two locations, total n = 375), Togiak Bay (two locations, total n = 280), Bering Sea (two locations, total n = 229), and Dutch Harbor (one location, n = 39).  Heart tissues (n = 629) that were analyzed for fatty acid profiles were necessarily destroyed during processing.  However, we collected additional heart tissue samples from Sitka (180), PWS-NE (157), Kamishak (180), Kodiak (255), Togiak (161), and Bering Sea (190) to archive in frozen storage (-70 C) at the Auke Bay Lab (NMFS). Unused otoliths from approximately 735 herring collected in these same six areas in 2006-7 are archived in frozen storage (still in heads) at the ADFG office in Homer.  Fin clips from approximately 1,010 herring collected in these six areas in 2006-2007 are archived in alcohol at the ADFG office in Homer.  All electronic data (e.g., age, sex, size, fatty acid and otolith microchemistry profiles) are archived  in an Excel spreadsheet at the ADFG office in Homer and were also submitted to EVOS for archival. These data were collected under EVOS Project 070769 for the purpose of attempting to identify stock structure among spawning aggregations of Pacific herring in Alaska.

"206","df35a.21.25","urn:node:GOA","This dataset contains the short-term survival and tag loss data from tagging of juvenile pink salmon with passive integrated transpondar (PIT) tags in southwestern Prince William Sound, Alaska. The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office). The United States Forest Service (Dirk Lang) also loaned a portable PIT tag reader.","Tag detection and mortality in pink salmon captured in Prince William Sound, Alaska: 2005","Steve Moffitt"

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

Live images were transmitted to Homer by microwave via a repeater atop Mt. Bede, on the southwestern Kenai Peninsula. Between 23 June and 4 September Pratt Museum and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff worked in the museum with the cameras as public interpreters and data collectors. They helped teach nearly 15,000 visitors about seabirds, predator-prey relationships, habitat, and scientific research. Productivity data for a selected study plot was collected by camera at the museum and by observers in the field using binoculars and telescopes. Comparison of data sets revealed variations between data from camera and field observations. With camera observation fewer murres were counted, adult postures more frequently misidentified, eggs and chicks less frequently seen, and different hatch dates recorded. Calculated results for measures of
productivity were similar between the two methods, however. Public interaction with interpreter/data collectors greatly enhanced education and outreach but may have been one factor responsible for variation between camera-derived and field-derived data. Electronic interference, problems of hardware/software design, and delayed field maintenance were among other factors influencing camera effectiveness. These data include raw counts only and do not include vistitor participation data.

"210","df35d.228.5","urn:node:GOA","Study History: A comprehensive assessment of coastal habitat was initiated as Coastal Habitat Study No. 1 in 1989 following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In 1990, experimental studies began in Herring Bay, Knight Island, Prince William Sound, which were designed to compliment the overall monitoring program by experimentally assessing intertidal community dynamics and mechanisms of recovery. This experimental approach went beyond basic species inventories, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of the oil spill impacts on physical and biological interactions mediating community structure. The manipulative experiments were designed to evaluate the strength of important species interactions and the role of physical factors in community structure. 

Abstract: Intertidal studies established in 1990 in Herring Bay, Prince William Sound in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill continued through the 1995 field season. Examination of the dominant intertidal alga, Fucus gardneri, showed that in the high intertidal, reproductive plants had fewer receptacles per plant and egg settlement rates were lower at oiled than control sites. Fucus germlings were negatively affected by herbivores and desiccation. Excluding plants which lost thallus material, plants grew faster at oiled than control sites. Experiments employing biodegradable erosion control fabric mats to act as a substrate for Fucus germlings were initiated in 1993 on a sheltered rocky site which had been heavily oiled. Dense populations of Fucus had developed on the surface of the mats by the summer 1994. Populations of intertidal grazing invertebrates, such as limpets and periwinkles continued to show reduced densities on oiled sites in 1994. Results of comparisons of mussel size-frequency, filamentous algae abundance and mussel recruitment in filamentous algae on oiled and control sites showed a higher abundance of smaller and recruiting mussels and filamentous algae on oiled sites. These patterns appear to be related to the detection of higher water motion on oiled sites based on calcium sulphate cylinder dissolution rates.

"213","df35a.21.30","urn:node:GOA","This dataset contains the short-term survival and tag loss data from tagging of juvenile pink salmon with passive integrated transpondar (PIT) tags in southwestern Prince William Sound, Alaska. The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office). The United States Forest Service (Dirk Lang) also loaned a portable PIT tag reader.","Tag detection and mortality in pink salmon captured in Prince William Sound, Alaska: 2005","Steve Moffitt"

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

"216","df35d.231.3","urn:node:GOA","In 2001, Short et al. (2004) identified residual oil from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in intertidal sediments. In the current study, five pairs of intertidal stations, each composed of one oiled and one nearby unoiled station (as identified by concurrent National Marine Fisheries Service studies), were evaluated for potential ecological impacts due to subsurface lingering oil. Oiled sediments were not toxic in the larval mussel bioassay using Mytilusedulis galloprovincialis, where development and survival in the 100% elutriate were equivalent to the unoiled stations and the controls. Significant toxicity was observed in the 28âday amphipod bioassay using Leptocheirus plumulosus, where survival at the oiled stations was 0% while survival in the unoiled stations ranged from 37 to 84%. Survival was inversely related to sediment PAH and positively related to percent fines (p<0.05). However, decreased survival in the unoiled sediments suggests that this test may have been influenced by the predominance of very coarse sediments and a lack of fineâgrained sediments. Benthic community structure was found to be similar between most oiled and unoiled stations; however, the power of statistical tests was low due to replicate variability. Study results indicate that residual oil sequestered in intertidal sediments is not causing communityâwide effects though populations of sensitive species, such as amphipods, may be impaired.

The data from these surveys are part of a pole-to-pole latitudinal biodiversity gradient of macroalgal rocky bottom communities, which is applying standardized protocols developed under the Census of Marine Life program. Georeferenced species occurrence data from this project have been added to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System database. The specific outcomes of this project include biodiversity species lists for each site and core area and various biodiversity analyses. A total of 242 invertebrate species/higher taxa groups and 237 macroalgal species/higher taxa groups were counted and/or weighed. Analyses of invertebrate and macroalgal groups showed that each core area and depth strata had unique descriptive genera/groups, however annual differences were not noted. Analyses also showed that intertidal communities differ in composition, biomass, and diversity than subtidal communities. Also, intertidal communities can not be used as an indicator for subtidal communities. These datasets are informative and should be used for current regional and global comparisons and future longterm monitoring programs.

Monitoring was continued in 1995-2011 as part of the EVOS Trustee Council restoration program. The North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) independently maintained a monitoring program in all other years since 1984. The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales. Vital rates for AB pod and all other frequently sighted resident pods have been calculated annually based on the photographic data.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

Monitoring was continued in 1995-2011 as part of the EVOS Trustee Council restoration program. The North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) independently maintained a monitoring program in all other years since 1984. The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales. Vital rates for AB pod and all other frequently sighted resident pods have been calculated annually based on the photographic data.","Comprehensive Killer Whale Investigation: Annual Photographic Survey Summaries in Alaska 1984 - 2011","Craig Matkin"

The initial research plan coupled parallel investigations on Kenai/Skilak Lakes in Cook Inlet with Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island. A final report on F/S No. 27 was published by D.C. Schmidt and K.E. Tarbox within the Fisheries Rehabilitation, Enhancement and Development Report series (No. 136) titled Sockeye Salmon Overescapement. Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al.

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Sockeye Salmon Overescapement: Zooplanton Sampling in Kodiak Island Lakes, Alaska, 1990 to 1996","Dana Schmidt"

Phase I was conducted in summer 1989/spring 1990 and involved site selection/ground truthing. Phase II involved intensive evaluation of study sites to determine extent of injury to natural resources in supratidal, intertidal and subtidal areas. Phase II commenced in the fall of 1989 and continued through the summer of 1991. The supratidal component was completed in 1991 and a final report was submitted separately. The subtidal portion was integrated into a suite of other subtidal studies and findsings were also reported separately. Draft preliminary status reports were issued for the intertidal componenet in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 by Highsmith et al. as Coastal Habitat Study No. 1: Phase II in 1990 and 1991 and No. 1A in 1992 and 1993.

Abstract: The CoastalHabitat Injury Assessment Study was initiated to assess injury to intertidal habitats impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The study, conducted from 1989-1991, encompassed three major geographical areas impacted by the spill: Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet-Kenia Peninsula and Kodiak-Alaska Peninsula. Oiled sites were selected randomly and matched with non-oiled sites and classified into sheltered rocky, exposed rocky, coarse textured or estuarine habitat. Statistically significant differences between oiled and non-oiled sites were interpreted as impact due to the spill and/or clean-up activities. Most observed differences varied across regions, habitats and tidal heights. Algae, especially the perennial Fucus, was generally negatively impacted on oiled sites. Conversely, an increase in annual and ephemeral species in the lower intertidal occurred. Limpets, mussels, littorines, and the high cockscomb prickleback were injured by the spill, while oligochaetes and a single barnacle species were enhanced at most tidal heights following the spill. Although intertidal communities showed widespread impact from oiling/clean-up activities for algal, invertebrate and fish components, data revealed most habitats were recovering but had fully recovered by 1991.

After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, many researchers began measuring hydrocarbon concentrations in mussels, sediment, and other matrices in Prince William Sound to assess resource damage. The specific focus of this project was dense aggregations of intertidal mussels (Mytilus trossulus) within the slick trajectory. Oil accumulated in these filter-feeders; total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were high in 1989 and remained relatively high for several years in mussel beds on unconsolidated sediment. The persistence of oil in these beds in Prince William Sound and along the Gulf of Alaska caused concern, and beginning in 1992 heavily oiled beds were systematically surveyed for oil content in mussel tissue and underlying sediment. Projections from earlier data (through 1995) were that oil would persist for up to three decades, thus funding for study was extended through 1999. This report synthesizes all available natural resource damage assessment data (17 independent studies) to develop a coherent picture of spatial and temporal oil distributions in mussels and sediment.

Abstract: 
Exxon Valdez oil trapped in intertidal sediment in Prince William Sound degraded slowly, was biologically available for at least a decade, and was toxic for at least 9 years. Habitat condition controlled the biological availability of oil. Exposure duration was short where mussels were only exposed to oil in water (months) and long (6 to 10 years) at locations where oil remained in sediment. Limited evidence suggests some oiling extended outside previously reported slick boundaries; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sources were verified with three independent petrogenic composition models. After an initial peak, oil concentrations typically declined in sediment and mussels, although distribution was non-uniform and variability was often high. Oil may persist in some intertidal sediment for >50 years, but declines in mussel tissue suggest it became less available to surface organisms and this community is recovering. Attempts to manually accelerate hydrocarbon loss from mussel beds were equivocal, demonstrating that removal of oil from intertidal sediment is difficult. Exposure to residual oil may explain why some vertebrate populations (pigeon guillemots, Cepphus columba, and sea otters, Enhydra lutris) that forage in the most heavily impacted areas have not yet fully recovered from the spill.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Sockeye Salmon Overescapement: Limnology in Kodiak Island Lakes, Alaska, 1990 to 1996","Dana Schmidt"
"233","df35d.7.10","urn:node:GOA","Study History: 
After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, many researchers began measuring hydrocarbon concentrations in mussels, sediment, and other matrices in Prince William Sound to assess resource damage. The specific focus of this project was dense aggregations of intertidal mussels (Mytilus trossulus) within the slick trajectory. Oil accumulated in these filter-feeders; total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were high in 1989 and remained relatively high for several years in mussel beds on unconsolidated sediment. The persistence of oil in these beds in Prince William Sound and along the Gulf of Alaska caused concern, and beginning in 1992 heavily oiled beds were systematically surveyed for oil content in mussel tissue and underlying sediment. Projections from earlier data (through 1995) were that oil would persist for up to three decades, thus funding for study was extended through 1999. This report synthesizes all available natural resource damage assessment data (17 independent studies) to develop a coherent picture of spatial and temporal oil distributions in mussels and sediment.

Abstract: 
Exxon Valdez oil trapped in intertidal sediment in Prince William Sound degraded slowly, was biologically available for at least a decade, and was toxic for at least 9 years. Habitat condition controlled the biological availability of oil. Exposure duration was short where mussels were only exposed to oil in water (months) and long (6 to 10 years) at locations where oil remained in sediment. Limited evidence suggests some oiling extended outside previously reported slick boundaries; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sources were verified with three independent petrogenic composition models. After an initial peak, oil concentrations typically declined in sediment and mussels, although distribution was non-uniform and variability was often high. Oil may persist in some intertidal sediment for >50 years, but declines in mussel tissue suggest it became less available to surface organisms and this community is recovering. Attempts to manually accelerate hydrocarbon loss from mussel beds were equivocal, demonstrating that removal of oil from intertidal sediment is difficult. Exposure to residual oil may explain why some vertebrate populations (pigeon guillemots, Cepphus columba, and sea otters, Enhydra lutris) that forage in the most heavily impacted areas have not yet fully recovered from the spill.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

"235","df35a.21.16","urn:node:GOA","This dataset contains the short-term survival and tag loss data from tagging of juvenile pink salmon with passive integrated transpondar (PIT) tags in southwestern Prince William Sound, Alaska. The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.  

The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council provided most of the funding for this project. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game contrbuted a significant amount of vessel time and PIT tag readers and data loggers (Mark Williette in the Soldotna office). The United States Forest Service (Dirk Lang) also loaned a portable PIT tag reader.","Management applications: Implementing the SEA Pink Salmon Survival Model - Tagging technology: 2005","Steve Moffitt"

Sample locations included Prince William Sound (4 sites) and Kodiak Island(1site)intheGulfof Alaska, and Togiak Bay (1 site) and Norton Sound (1 site) in the Bering Sea. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a marked genetic discontinuity between herring in the Bering Sea and Gulfof Alaska. The estimatesof genetic differentiation between populations from the two sea basins (F_BT) were significant (P<0.001) and ranged from 0.169 for mtDNA to 0.209 for microsatellites. The estimates of genetic differentiation within sea basins (F_SB) were 0.013 for mtDNA and 0.030f or microsatellites and were significant (P<0.001). The microsatellites also showed significant (P<0.001) temporal variation within the Gulf of Alaska. The estimates of genetic variation between years at each sample location(F_SL) were 0.011 formicrosatellites and 0.012 for mtDNA. The temporal shifts in genetic structure may reflect large inter-annual variation in reproductive success and hamper the use of genetic markers for discrete stock management of herring in Prince William Sound.

This multi-year study was initiated in FY94 as Restoration Project 94165. However, a return failure of herring in Prince William Sound in 1994 delayed implementation until FY95. During the first two years (FY95, FY96) new molecular markers were developed and tested for population genetic analyses. In addition, herring samples were collected from spawning aggregations within Prince William Sound (4 sites), Kodiak Island(1 site), TogiakBay (1 site), and Norton Sound(1 site). During the final two years (FY97, FY98) samples were genotyped and genetic data were analyzed. Preliminary results were reported to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS)Trustee Council and EVOS project reviewers in a poster session at the January1996 EVOS workshop in Anchorage. A synthesis of the herring genetic data was reported to the EVOS peer reviewers in February 1998. Four reports were submitted consulting scientists detailing the development and application of mtDNA and microsatellite markers. One progress report was submitted by the principal investigators in 1996 under the title Genetic Discrimination of Prince William Sound Herring Populations.

"237","jstocking.4.8","urn:node:GOA","This project is a component of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Councilâs integrated, multi-project program known as âGulfwatchâ (Long-term Monitoring of Marine Conditions and Injured Resources and Services).  The vast majority of seabird monitoring in areas affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill has taken place around breeding colonies during the reproductive season, a time when food is generally at its most plentiful.  However, seabirds spend most of the year widely dispersed.  Late fall through winter are critical periods for survival as food tends to be relatively scarce or inaccessible, the climate more extreme, light levels reduced, day length shorter and water temperatures colder.  Post-spill ecosystem recovery and changing physical and biological factors all have the potential to affect Prince William Sound (PWS) seabird populations.  Of the seabirds that overwinter in PWS, nine species were initially injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, including three species that have not yet recovered (marbled murrelet, Kittlitzâs murrelet and pigeon guillemot).  From October 2011 through Decembe 2016, this project will monitor marine bird abundance, species composition, and habitat associations using multiple surveys (up to 5 surveys per season) during late fall and winter.  The data will improve our predictive models of marine bird species abundance and distribution in relation to biological and physical environmental factors.  In addition, by monitoring the top-down forcing by marine birds, a major source of herring predation, this project will complement the suite of PWS Herring Research & Monitoring studies, including improved mortality estimates for herring population models.  This project is part of the pelagic component within the integrated Gulfwatch program.  Our project uses as observing platforms the vessels associated with the Gulfwatch Humpback Whale surveys and PWS Herring Research & Monitoring Juvenile Herring Abundance Index as well as the Extended Adult Herring Biomass Surveys (year 2 onward) and integrates the marine bird observations with those studies.","Long-term monitoring of seabird abundance and habitat associations during late fall and winter in Prince William Sound","Mary Anne Bishop"

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

The acquisition of private lands, or partial interests in private lands, is intended to promote natural recovery of spill-injured resources and services by removing the threat of additional development impacts. These lands will be managed in perpetuity for the restoration and protection of resources and services injured by the spill and for the enjoyment of the public for purposes of subsistence use, sport fishing and hunting, personal use fishing, trapping, recreational uses and commercial fishing.

The Comprehensive Habitat Protection Process is the method that was designed to achieve this objective. During the Large Parcel Process, over one million acres within the oil spill affected area were evaluated, scored, and ranked by a multi-cri- teria evaluation process. Initially lands were divided into large parcels encompass- ing entire bays and watersheds. Criteria were used to assess the habitat and human use values associated with each parcel and the protection benefit that acquisition would provide for 19 injured resources and associated services. This process pro- vided the basis for the acquisition of protective bundles of rights on over 637,000 acres of land in the Kodiak, Kenai Peninsula, and Prince William Sound regions.

During the Small Parcel Process, smaller parcels, those less than 1,000 acres nominated by willing sellers, were also evaluated using criteria modified to reflect the unique benefits to injured resources that smaller parcels could provide in relation to the surrounding environment, management units and local communities. Over 9,000 acres were protected through this process.

We will assess the significance of humpback whale predation on herring in PWS, particularly in winter. Specifically we will estimate the number of whales foraging in winter, determine when and if there is a prey switch to herring, and how long whales focus on herring as prey. Year one was funded, small in scale with an intense monitoring strategy; year 2 would expand the scale up in area significantly. Year 3 will verify the impact on herring of the high numbers of humpback whales we observed in PWS during year 2. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed (and energy content consumed). Lastly, the estimated numbers of herring consumed would be included in an age-structured model so that the significance of whale predation on herring recovery can be evaluated. Year 4 (2010) will close out the project with the completion of analysis, reports, and manuscripts. This data set focuses on the humpback whale surveys including survey effort, whale identification, photo quality, whale behavior, prey items and tissue samples.","Significance of Whale Predation On Natural Mortality Rate of Pacific Herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska: 2006 - 2009, 2011-2012","Jeep Rice"

"246","df35d.252.6","urn:node:GOA","Study History: The purpose of this study was to characterize the basic ecology, distribution, and demographics of sand lance in lower Cook Inlet. Recent declines of upper trophic level species in the northern Gulf of Alaska have been linked to decreasing availability of forage fishes. Sand lance is the most important forage fish in most nearshore areas of the northern Gulf. Despite its importance to commercial fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, little is known or published on the basic biology of this key prey species. Therefore, restoration project /306 was established to work in coordination with restoration APEX project /163M to help characterize the relationship between seabird population dynamics and forage fish abundance. 

Abstract: Distinct sand lance populations occur within the relatively small geographic area of Lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. Marked meso-scale differences in abundance, growth, and mortality exist as a consequence of differing oceanographic regimes. Growth rate within populations (between years) was positively correlated with temperature. However, this did not extend to inter-population comparisons where differing growth rates were better correlated to marine productivity. Most sand lance reached maturity in their second year. Field observations and indices of maturity, gonad development, and ova-size distribution all indicated that sand lance spawn once each year. Sand lance spawned intertidally in late September and October on fine gravel/sandy beaches. Embryos developed over 67 days through periods of intertidal exposure and sub-freezing air temperatures. Mean dry-weight energy value of sand lance cycles seasonally, peaking in spring and early summer, and subsequently declining by about 25% during late summer and fall. Sand lance enter the winter with close to their minimum whole body energy content.

Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon.

Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities.

Data indicated that LWC contained significant amounts of spawning habitat that were underutilized by pink and coho salmon due to an ineffective barrier bypass structure. The project priorities were to renovate the bypass to reduce gradients and design resting pools to minimize water velocity. The bypass renovation was completed in the fall 1995; bypass gradients were reduced from 27% to 17-20% and two additional resting pools and an entrance pool were installed. The steeppass sections were staggered between pools to reduce the velocity of stream flows. The historical performance of the three bypasses at LWC, since installation in 198 1, has been significant, increasing average pink salmon escapements from -7,000 to -70,000 fish. The number of pink salmon migrating by way of all three bypasses to spawn in upstream habitat has significantly increased resultant returns; however, regression analysis was driven by the large upstream escapement in 1993. The historical proportion of the total annual pink salmon escapement to migrate upstream has primarily been a function of the design and performance of the largest (most upstream) bypass.

Abstract: Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi) were captured in the coastal regions of Southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, Prince William Sound (PWS), and Kodiak Island during 1976-1999. Blood was collected from 286 seals. Sera were tested for evidence of exposure to Brucella spp., phocid herpesvirus-1 (PhoHV-1), phocid herpesvirus-2 (PhHV-2), and phocine distemper virus (PDV). Antibody prevalence rates were 46% (46/100) for Brucella spp., 93% (225/243) for PhoHV-1, 0% (0/286) for PhHV-2, and 1% (2/160) for PDV. Antibody prevalence for Brucella spp. was directly related to host age. Antibody prevalence for PhoHV-1 was higher in PWS as compared to the other three regions. No evidence of mortality attributable to these four agents was observed during the course of this study. Based on the results of this survey, none of these agents is considered a significant mortality factor in harbor seals from the four regions of coastal Alaska included in the study.

From 1980-2002 mean numbers of pups, adjusted for environmental conditions, declined 88% from 148 to 18 pups and remained stable through 2007 while seals counted during molt declined 82% from 801 seals to 141seals. Since 2002, numbers of molting seals have shown rapid growth of 21%/yr, coincident with use of expanding habitat near Pedersen Glacier. Results indicate that Aialik Bay, especially Pedersen Lake, is a favorable molt location, but low pup counts indicate continued poor recruitment. Kayak interactions and seal behavior were evaluated from 2004-2007. Results showed seals in Pedersen Lake abandoned the ice more frequently when humans were present. Although guided trips caused less impact than unguided trips, mitigation training provided to guides resulted in a further reduction in numbers of seals abandoning the ice.

Purpose: Population studies of harbor seals using glacial ice in Aialik Bay were first conducted from 1979-1981 (Hoover 1983) and were continued intermittently through 1995 (NPS unpublished, Hoover-Miller unpublished). Beginning in 2002, the National Park Serviceâs Ocean Alaska Science and Learning Center supported the development and use of remotely controlled video cameras to document information on numbers of seals at haulouts and haulout attendance relative to local environmental conditions, glacier activity and interactions between humans and seals since 2002.

Description of data: Two primary data sets are produced by the video monitoring project: one includes count, environmental co-variates, video camera performance, and general video tape log, and the other includes video observations pertaining to vessel interactions with harbor seals. Format â Primary data associated with video monitoring have been incorporated into two Access databases. Original video images are stored on VHS video tape; a digital conversion of a subset of records is planned for 2008.

In 1990, experimental studies began in Herring Bay, Knight Island, Prince William Sound, which were designed to compliment the overall monitoring program by experimentally assessing intertidal community dynamics and mechanisms of recovery. This experimental approach went beyond basic species inventories, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of the oil spill impacts on physical and biological interactions mediating community structure. The manipulative experiments were designed to evaluate the strength of important species interactions and the role of physical factors in community structure. 

Abstract: Intertidal studies established in 1990 in Herring Bay, Prince William Sound in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill continued through the 1995 field season. Examination of the dominant intertidal alga, Fucus gardneri, showed that in the high intertidal, reproductive plants had fewer receptacles per plant and egg settlement rates were lower at oiled than control sites. Fucus germlings were negatively affected by herbivores and desiccation. Excluding plants which lost thallus material, plants grew faster at oiled than control sites. Experiments employing biodegradable erosion control fabric mats to act as a substrate for Fucus germlings were initiated in 1993 on a sheltered rocky site which had been heavily oiled. Dense populations of Fucus had developed on the surface of the mats by the summer 1994. Populations of intertidal grazing invertebrates, such as limpets and periwinkles continued to show reduced densities on oiled sites in 1994. Results of comparisons of mussel size-frequency, filamentous algae abundance and mussel recruitment in filamentous algae on oiled and control sites showed a higher abundance of smaller and recruiting mussels and filamentous algae on oiled sites. These patterns appear to be related to the detection of higher water motion on oiled sites based on calcium sulphate cylinder dissolution rates.

The acquisition of private lands, or partial interests in private lands, is intended to promote natural recovery of spill-injured resources and services by removing the threat of additional development impacts. These lands will be managed in perpetuity for the restoration and protection of resources and services injured by the spill and for the enjoyment of the public for purposes of subsistence use, sport fishing and hunting, personal use fishing, trapping, recreational uses and commercial fishing.

The Comprehensive Habitat Protection Process is the method that was designed to achieve this objective. During the Large Parcel Process, over one million acres within the oil spill affected area were evaluated, scored, and ranked by a multi-cri- teria evaluation process. Initially lands were divided into large parcels encompass- ing entire bays and watersheds. Criteria were used to assess the habitat and human use values associated with each parcel and the protection benefit that acquisition would provide for 19 injured resources and associated services. This process pro- vided the basis for the acquisition of protective bundles of rights on over 637,000 acres of land in the Kodiak, Kenai Peninsula, and Prince William Sound regions.

During the Small Parcel Process, smaller parcels, those less than 1,000 acres nominated by willing sellers, were also evaluated using criteria modified to reflect the unique benefits to injured resources that smaller parcels could provide in relation to the surrounding environment, management units and local communities. Over 9,000 acres were protected through this process.","Habitat Protection and Acquisition Support for EVOSTC in Alaska: 1993 - 2004",NA
"262","df35d.344.4","urn:node:GOA","We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to localized declines of the black leather chiton, Katharina tunicata, on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

We recorded 58 species of seabirds, which were dominated numerically by five species; species-richness was greatest in October and May and lowest in December and March. Abundance was greatest in May and October, in the winters of 1997â1998 and 1999â2000, and, depending on the species, at the shelf-break front or in the mid-shelf. The shelf-break front is highly important to the overwinter survival of a variety of bird and mammal species; the mid-shelf zone appears to be important to a suite of diving seabirds that concentrate on nekton, especially fishes. We recorded 10 species of marine mammals, which were dominated numerically by Dall's Porpoises; the seasonal pattern of species-richness was identical to that seen for seabirds. Abundance of Dall's Porpoises was greatest in the Alaska Coastal Current, whereas several other species were concentrated at the shelf-break or widespread. We conclude that an at-sea monitoring program can provide valuable information on wintering seabirds and recommend that a seabird monitoring component be added to the proposed Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring Program.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

Subsequent studies (93002, 94258, 95258, 96258 and 97251) focused on restoration efforts which consisted of continued monitoring of the affected populations with an interim ADF&G Regional Information Report (No. 5J95-15) published by Schmidt et al. (1995). The data collected from Kodiak Archipelago sockeye populations were included in these reports while publications focused solely upon Kodiak Island sockeye data with limited analyses have also been generated: Barrett et al. (1993a, 1993b); Swanton and Nelson (1995); Swanton et al. (1996). 

Abstract: The impacts of large escapements on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) systems with freshwater production constrained by limitations on lake rearing capacity were substantiated with empirical data for several Alaskan stocks. As a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Red and Akalura lakes on Kodiak Island received escapements that were 2X the upper end of the escapement goals. Data collected were macrozooplankton biomass, species composition and size structure along with abundance and size of rearing fry and smolt. Two sockeye salmon systems, Upper Station and Frazer lakes, were used as controls. Zooplankton density and biomass decreased at both Red and Akalura lakes when fry from the 1989 brood year were present, however only the decrease for Akalura Lake sockeye was statistically significant. Rearing fry population estimates for both study lakes were deemed of low utility owing to numerous instances where they were less then subsequent smolt population estimates. Sockeye smolts from the 1989-1991 brood years exhibited increased percentages of age-2 fish alluding to the rearing environment having been impacted by heightened foraging of rearing fry. These results although not definitive, suggest that a depression in the rearing environment was caused by the 1989 escapement event and persisted through 1992.","Sockeye Salmon Overescapement: Smolt Age, Weight and Length (1990-1997) and Sockeye Escapement (1983-1993) in Kodiak Island Lakes, Alaska","Dana Schmidt"
"266","df35d.326.6","urn:node:GOA","We examined the distribution and abundance of marine birds and mammals in the northern Gulf of Alaska over five seasons during the winters of 1997-2001. We recorded 58 species of seabirds, which were dominated numerically by five species; species-richness was greatest in October and May and lowest in December and March. Abundance was greatest in May and October, in the winters of 1997-1998 and 1999-2000, and, depending on the species, at the shelf-break front or in the mid-shelf. The shelf-break front is highly important to the overwinter survival of a variety of bird and mammal species; the mid-shelf zone appears to be important to a suite of diving seabirds that concentrate on nekton, especially fishes. We recorded 10 species of marine mammals, which were dominated numerically by Dall's Porpoises; the seasonal pattern of species-richness was identical to that seen for seabirds. Abundance of Dall's Porpoises was greatest in the Alaska Coastal Current, whereas several other species were concentrated at the shelf-break or widespread. We conclude that an at-sea monitoring program can provide valuable information on wintering seabirds and recommend that a seabird monitoring component be added to the proposed Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring Program.

We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

The vast majority of seabird monitoring in areas affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill has taken place around breeding colonies during the reproductive season, a time when food is generally at its most plentiful.  However, seabirds spend most of the year widely dispersed.  Late fall through winter are critical periods for survival as food tends to be relatively scarce or inaccessible, the climate more extreme, light levels reduced, day length shorter and water temperatures colder.  Post-spill ecosystem recovery and changing physical and biological factors all have the potential to affect Prince William Sound (PWS) seabird populations.  Of the seabirds that overwinter in PWS, nine species were initially injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, including three species that have not yet recovered (marbled murrelet, Kittlitzâs murrelet and pigeon guillemot).  From October 2011 through Decembe 2016, this project will monitor marine bird abundance, species composition, and habitat associations using multiple surveys (up to 5 surveys per season) during late fall and winter.  The data will improve our predictive models of marine bird species abundance and distribution in relation to biological and physical environmental factors.  In addition, by monitoring the top-down forcing by marine birds, a major source of herring predation, this project will complement the suite of PWS Herring Research & Monitoring studies, including improved mortality estimates for herring population models.  This project is part of the pelagic component within the integrated Gulfwatch program.  Our project uses as observing platforms the vessels associated with the Gulfwatch Humpback Whale surveys and PWS Herring Research & Monitoring Juvenile Herring Abundance Index as well as the Extended Adult Herring Biomass Surveys (year 2 onward) and integrates the marine bird observations with those studies.","Long-term monitoring of seabird abundance and habitat associations during late fall and winter in Prince William Sound","Mary Anne Bishop"

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

The general mission of this Natural Resource Damage Assessment floating oil mapping effort was to document the extent, amount and persistence of oil resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989. While the aerial overflight mapping effort has been reduced since mid May, to one flight a day from two or three, there are still regular aerial overflights being performed to monitor the location and extent of oil in the water. Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering. Other techniques are used to display the identified oil relative to regions of suspended sediment where the oil may have become sufficiently heavy to have become submerged.","Geographic Extent, Temporal Persistence and Mapping of Floating Oil from the the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: 1989","Marshal Kendziorek"

Sampling water from the sea chest of the ship at 4m, the underway system measured: (1) temperature and salinity: basic physical variables, (2) nitrate: an essential phytoplankton nutrient, (3) chlorophyll fluorescence: an indicator of phytoplankton concentration, (4) colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence: an indicator of terrestrial runoff, and (5) optical beam transmittance: an indicator of suspended sediment. The measurements show large spatial variability at short time scales, but spatially coherent climate change over annual time scales. Governed by snow and ice melt, the ocean climate transitioned from a warm, fresh regime in 2004-2005 to a cold, salty regime in 2007-2008. Agreement with observations at the GAK1 monitoring site near Seward, AK, extends their applicability to the northern Gulf of Alaskas continental shelf. Nitrate and chlorophyll measurements show nutrient-rich periods lead to increased phytoplankton. A computer monitor displayed the water temperature along the route and mapped the progress of the ferry. The successful measurement program and connections to long-term climate change demonstrate the utility of oceanographic measurements from ferryboats.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

Since 1993, the council has monitored samples from mussels and sediments at 10 sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. The samples are monitored for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons. Samples are collected in summer and late winter and results are presented in an annual report. This information provides a benchmark for assessing the ongoing impacts of routine tanker and terminal operations. The program has sampled twice a year since 1994 for evidence of hydrocarbons in mussel tissue and sediment samples. In recent years, the program was cut back to just mussel tissue at all sites with subtidal sediments only in Port Valdez (site of Alyeska Marine Terminal's tanker operations). For more complete sampling in Port Valdez, mussels are also collected in October. All samples are analyzed for PAH and AHC; sediments are also analzyed for TOC and sediment grain size. Results from PWSRCAC's studies indicate a variety of sources of hydrocarbons in Prince William Sound including the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, operations at the Alyeska terminal, combustion sources, boating and shipping activities, normal oil seepage or coal deposits, biological processes, and atmospheric fallout. Generally, the hydrocarbon levels detected under LTEMP have been relatively low. The stations farthest from the Alyeska terminal show low hydrocarbon levels, while those closest to the terminal show higher levels. Concern over the hydrocarbon levels at the terminal prompted PWSRCAC to add an additional sampling effort at the two Port Valdez stations in the fall of each year.

A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Subsequently, annual reports were submitted entitled Habitat Use, Behavior, and Monitoring of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound: 1994 Annual Report, 1995 Annual Report, 1996 Annual Report , 1997 Annual Report, 1998 Annual Report, and 1999 Annual Report . Fatty acid studies funded under Restoration Project 94320-F (Trophic Interactions of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound) were included in the 1994 annual report for 94064. Fatty acid studies were continued and reported as part of this study for the duration of the project.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

Adult salmon returning to the site of release will provide replacement resources and associated services injured by the Exxon Valdez  oil spill. Three releases have taken place (1994, 1995, 1996) as part of this multi-year project. Adult salmon will begin returning in 1996 and 1997, with larger numbers projected at nearly 1,000 adult fish, returning in 1998 and thereafter.

Studv History: 50,000 chinook salmon smolt were released in the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996 at Crab Bay on Evans Island, Prince William Sound as part of an ongoing Trustee Council program to replace injured subsistence resources and services (Restoration Projects 94272,95272 and 96272). Chinook salmon return varying between adult ages of 4 and 7 years. A few adults are anticipated to begin returning in 1996, with nearly 1,000 returning in 1998 as the age classes build and releases continue. Chinook salmon returning to Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation's Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (WNH) at Esther Island were harvested as brood stock. Eggs were taken and incubated at the hatchery and the resultant fry reared for an additional year to smolt size. 50,000 smolt were released at Crab Bay. This annual cycle will continue through 1998.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

Monitoring was continued in 1995-2011 as part of the EVOS Trustee Council restoration program. The North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) independently maintained a monitoring program in all other years since 1984. The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales. Vital rates for AB pod and all other frequently sighted resident pods have been calculated annually based on the photographic data.

"282","df35b.118.3","urn:node:GOA","CYP1A has been used widely as an indicator of exposure of vertebrates to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the use of EROD activity as a measure of CYP1A has been validated and accepted as a standard method. EROD activity has been used since 1998 as an indicator of the degree of exposure of harlequin ducks to residual Exxon Valdez oil in Prince William Sound, Alaska. These data have proven to be extremely valuable for understanding the processes by which population recovery of harlequin ducks has been constrained following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. EROD activity data were collected in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2005 from wintering harlequin ducks captured in Prince William Sound; one reason for collecting these data was to provide a time series with which changes in exposure could be tracked over years. However, the data reported from the laboratory varied dramatically in magnitude from year to year, to a degree far beyond what could be expected due to normal biological variation. Similar variation was observed across years in harlequin ducks held at the Alaska SeaLife Center under strictly controlled circumstances. Therefore, this project was initiated to determine the explanation for this interannual variation, and to apply laboratory analyses and data standardization to allow valid interannual comparisons. Additional data analysis of EROD activity of wintering harlequin ducks captured in Prince William Sound in 2005 through 2007 confirmed that individual attributes (age, sex, and mass) and season of capture did not explain observed variation in EROD activity. In review of the originally reported EROD values, it was discovered that some data were reported in incorrect units. However, even after these were corrected, the large interannual discrepancies were not completely resolved. Other potential factors, such as low protein yields, were considered; exclusion of samples with low protein values, along with application of appropriate units, considerably reduced interannual variation, although differences were still apparent that reduced confidence in interannual comparisons. EROD reanalysis of old samples resulted in data that were correlated (R2 = 0.53) with original data, but values were considerably different in magnitude, possibly as a result of sample degradation or annually varying lab techniques or equipment. Also, not all individuals had adequate sample volume remaining for reanalysis, reducing the power for detecting differences across areas and years if only reanalyzed data were used. In consultation with the laboratory, it was concluded that changes in analysis approaches and equipment may have led to the observed interannual differences and that, although within-year comparisons between areas were valid, between-year comparisons were not appropriate without corrections. Therefore, a method indexing CYP1A values was created that allows for interannual contrasts, in which average EROD activity for harlequin ducks captured at our unoiled/control area (Montague Island) is set to 1 for each year and all values are adjusted accordingly within
the same sample year. Therefore, for each year, the average indexed EROD activity for
birds from oiled areas is a ratio of oiled to unoiled averages. The average indexed values
can be compared across years to consider annual changes in oil exposure, under the
assumption that oil exposure at unoiled Montague Island was the same across years.
Further, the indexed values can be calculated for each individual, which allows
consideration of relationships between individual variation in oil exposure and variation
in survival.","Quantifying Temporal Variation in Harlequin Duck Cytochrome P4501A Induction, Prince William Sound, Alaska  (1998-2002) - [UNFORMATTED]","Dan Esler"
"283","df35d.342.5","urn:node:GOA","We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline harvest leading to localized declines of the black leather chiton, Katharina tunicata, on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. Field surveys of the significant predictors of K. tunicata across 11 sites suggest that its current spatial variation is significantly related to human exploitation and sea otter predation. Traditional ecological knowledge further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea urchin, crab and clams) have declined sequentially, with reduced densities of K. tunicata being the most recent. We propose that a restriction in alternative prey species availability has led to recent intensified per capita predator impacts on K. tunicata. Experimental K. tunicata removals in the low intertidal revealed that at high densities, K. tunicata reduced the density of Alaria marginata, by 94% and species richness by 38%, and altered algal and invertebrate community structure. Across site comparisons showed that A. marginata biomass was 7 times greater at exploited versus unexploited sites. Furthermore, community structure differed significantly as a function of predation pressure. These results provide evidence of a trophic cascade and reveal the extent to which fishing and natural predation, via the reduction of a shared keystone resource, indirectly alter a temperate coastal ecosystem.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Sample locations included Prince William Sound (4 sites) and Kodiak Island(1site)intheGulfof Alaska, and Togiak Bay (1 site) and Norton Sound (1 site) in the Bering Sea. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a marked genetic discontinuity between herring in the Bering Sea and Gulfof Alaska. The estimatesof genetic differentiation between populations from the two sea basins (F_BT) were significant (P<0.001) and ranged from 0.169 for mtDNA to 0.209 for microsatellites. The estimates of genetic differentiation within sea basins (F_SB) were 0.013 for mtDNA and 0.030f or microsatellites and were significant (P<0.001). The microsatellites also showed significant (P<0.001) temporal variation within the Gulf of Alaska. The estimates of genetic variation between years at each sample location(F_SL) were 0.011 formicrosatellites and 0.012 for mtDNA. The temporal shifts in genetic structure may reflect large inter-annual variation in reproductive success and hamper the use of genetic markers for discrete stock management of herring in Prince William Sound.

This multi-year study was initiated in FY94 as Restoration Project 94165. However, a return failure of herring in Prince William Sound in 1994 delayed implementation until FY95. During the first two years (FY95, FY96) new molecular markers were developed and tested for population genetic analyses. In addition, herring samples were collected from spawning aggregations within Prince William Sound (4 sites), Kodiak Island(1 site), TogiakBay (1 site), and Norton Sound(1 site). During the final two years (FY97, FY98) samples were genotyped and genetic data were analyzed. Preliminary results were reported to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS)Trustee Council and EVOS project reviewers in a poster session at the January1996 EVOS workshop in Anchorage. A synthesis of the herring genetic data was reported to the EVOS peer reviewers in February 1998. Four reports were submitted consulting scientists detailing the development and application of mtDNA and microsatellite markers. One progress report was submitted by the principal investigators in 1996 under the title Genetic Discrimination of Prince William Sound Herring Populations.

In total, 2,117,781 raw sequencing reads were generated with an average length of 254 bp. All data was submitted to NBCIÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Short Read Archive under accession number SRX022719.

Multi-frequency acoustic/net sampling assessments of the pink salmon food supply and predators were conducted in Prince William Sound during spring 2001. Five cruises were completed between April 18 and June 15, 2001. The results of this monitoring were in sharp contrast with observations from the previous year. Overall the abundance of large copepods (primarily Neocalanus) was much lower in 2001. The abundance was highest at the beginning of the monitoring in mid-April, but progressively declined rather than increased as was seen in 2000. Highest biomasses were observed above the deep hole adjacent to Naked Island, and the lowest biomass within protected bays, including the locations of Esther and Main Bay hatcheries. The pattern of fish abundance and distribution was generally similar both years. Highest fish abundance was in the main basin and relatively deep. Abundance in the pink salmon out-migration corridor increased slightly over the spring, but was low overall. However, fish in the out-migration corridor showed strong near-shore orientation in 2001, a pattern not seen in 2000. The results of this monitoring should provide valuable insights into the complex environmental conditions that govern juvenile salmon survival. Such information is becoming more important as Alaska's salmon hatchery programs come under increasing scrutiny.

Adult salmon returning to the site of release will provide replacement resources and associated services injured by the Exxon Valdez  oil spill. Three releases have taken place (1994, 1995, 1996) as part of this multi-year project. Adult salmon will begin returning in 1996 and 1997, with larger numbers projected at nearly 1,000 adult fish, returning in 1998 and thereafter.

Studv History: 50,000 chinook salmon smolt were released in the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996 at Crab Bay on Evans Island, Prince William Sound as part of an ongoing Trustee Council program to replace injured subsistence resources and services (Restoration Projects 94272,95272 and 96272). Chinook salmon return varying between adult ages of 4 and 7 years. A few adults are anticipated to begin returning in 1996, with nearly 1,000 returning in 1998 as the age classes build and releases continue. Chinook salmon returning to Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation's Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (WNH) at Esther Island were harvested as brood stock. Eggs were taken and incubated at the hatchery and the resultant fry reared for an additional year to smolt size. 50,000 smolt were released at Crab Bay. This annual cycle will continue through 1998.

"291","df35b.114.5","urn:node:GOA","Harlequin ducks have been studied extensively in Prince William Sound during the restoration phase following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, leading to one of the most thorough considerations of wildlife population injury and recovery following a major oil spill ever undertaken. These efforts have included population monitoring by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as a series of directed research projects designed to elucidate the process of, and constraints to, population recovery. These studies demonstrated that harlequin ducks were exposed to lingering oil over a much longer time frame (i.e., through at least 2005, 16 years following the spill) than expected at the time of the spill, based on elevated levels of cytochrome P4501A induction in birds from oiled areas. In addition, several lines of evidence suggested that population injury occurred through at least 1998. Specifically, female winter survival probabilities were found to differ between oiled and unoiled areas, and densities were shown to be lower in oiled than unoiled areas after accounting for habitat-related effects. More recent data have indicated that female winter survival did not differ between oiled and unoiled sites during 2000-03, suggesting that direct effects of oil exposure on demographic properties may have abated.
In response to the data described above, the work here was proposed to add to the existing cytochrome P4501A monitoring data to track the timeline of exposure to lingering oil, and to assemble the demographic data collected during previous restoration studies into a quantitative population model to allow consideration of the timing and magnitude of oil spill injury, the mechanisms by which injury occurred and population recovery was constrained, and the current status of recovery, including predictions for timing of full recovery.

 FINDINGS: We found that cytochrome P4501A induction during winters 2005, 2006-07, and 2009 was higher in harlequin ducks captured in areas of Prince William Sound oiled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, relative to unoiled areas. Cytochrome P4501A induction did not vary in relation to age, sex, or mass of individuals, nor did it vary strongly by season in samples collected early and late in the winter. We interpret these results to indicate that harlequin ducks continued to be exposed to residual Exxon Valdez oil up to 20 years after the original spill. Population modeling efforts indicated that female mortality related to chronic exposure to lingering oil was nearly double that estimated during the acute phase (the weeks and months immediately post-spill). Full recovery to pre-spill numbers was estimated to require between 13 and 32 years, with the most likely recovery scenario requiring roughly 24 years. Taken together, the data presented in this report add to a growing body of literature suggesting that effects of oil spills on wildlife have the potential to be expressed over much longer time frames than previously assumed.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

Public interaction with interpreter/data collectors greatly enhanced education and outreach but may have been one factor responsible for variation between camera-derived and field-derived data.

We found that the initial conclusions were accurate, indicating that a considerable proportion of mixed-soft beaches in treated areas of the sound remained extremely disturbed and that these beaches are functionally impaired in terms of their ability to support foraging by humans and damaged nearshore vertebrate predators such as sea otters 13 years after the spill. Large, long-lived hard-shell clams remained 66% less abundant at Treated sites than at Reference sites. We also found that standard sediment properties did not appear implicated in lagging recovery. But, based on several lines of evidence, we deduced that a major cause for the delay was the disruption of surface armoring (a stratified organization of mixed-soft shoreline sediments common in southcentral Alaska), an effect of beach washing. Based on the apparent recovery trajectory, we predict that recovery to pre-spill status will take several more decades. We also found that sedimentary components and the biota in the armored mixed-soft sediments in Prince William Sound do not respond according to traditionally described paradigms for homogeneous sediments.

Monitoring was continued in 1995-2011 as part of the EVOS Trustee Council restoration program. The North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) independently maintained a monitoring program in all other years since 1984. The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales. Vital rates for AB pod and all other frequently sighted resident pods have been calculated annually based on the photographic data.","Comprehensive Killer Whale Investigation: Annual Photographic Survey Summaries in Alaska 1984 - 2012","Craig Matkin"

The general mission of this Natural Resource Damage Assessment floating oil mapping effort was to document the extent, amount and persistence of oil resulting from the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill. Maps have been produced on a regular basis showing the location of oil from aerial surveys from the first day of the spill on March 24, 1989. While the aerial overflight mapping effort has been reduced since mid May, to one flight a day from two or three, there are still regular aerial overflights being performed to monitor the location and extent of oil in the water. Another source of information that yielded answers on the extent of floating oil was satellite imagery. The data source used here consists of imagery obtained from a variety of polar-orbiting satellites. The function of the satellite imagery portion of this study is to revise digital filtering techniques to remove noise and to perform digital enhancements to improve the identification of oil. In addition, the satellite imagery will be enhanced to provide oceanographic data useful in determining the oil's trajectory as well as its weathering, mixing with suspended sediments and related evolution. Finally, there is a possibility that some of the satellite imagery will yield information that will document the extent of oiled beaches.

The aerial overflights produce three basic data types. The first type is a hard copy of a nautical chart with observers notes and markings indicating the location and extent of the oil as well as the flight track taken by this crew. The second data type is video tape showing the oil on the water. The third data type is a written report from the observers with any other observations they may have as well as weather information indicating the observing conditions. In many instances still photographs also exist from the flight. All of this information is combined to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

The satellites produce image format data of the earth's surface in a variety of wavelength bands ranging from blue visible light to the thermal infrared Some of these bands are useful for the identification of oil while others are useful for identification of suspended sediment, the thermal regime, and possibly large concentrations of plankton. The oil signature in most cases is only slightly different from that of the ocean, requiring sophisticated digital image enhancement techniques to separate the two. It is possible that the oil signature will be found to change over time as a result of its weathering. Other techniques are used to display the identified oil relative to regions of suspended sediment where the oil may have become sufficiently heavy to have become submerged.","Geographic Extent, Temporal Persistence and Mapping of Floating Oil from the the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill: 1989","Marshal Kendziorek"

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Subsequently, annual reports were submitted entitled Habitat Use, Behavior, and Monitoring of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound: 1994 Annual Report, 1995 Annual Report, 1996 Annual Report , 1997 Annual Report, 1998 Annual Report, and 1999 Annual Report . Fatty acid studies funded under Restoration Project 94320-F (Trophic Interactions of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound) were included in the 1994 annual report for 94064. Fatty acid studies were continued and reported as part of this study for the duration of the project.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

"313","df35d.252.7","urn:node:GOA","Study History: The purpose of this study was to characterize the basic ecology, distribution, and demographics of sand lance in lower Cook Inlet. Recent declines of upper trophic level species in the northern Gulf of Alaska have been linked to decreasing availability of forage fishes. Sand lance is the most important forage fish in most nearshore areas of the northern Gulf. Despite its importance to commercial fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, little is known or published on the basic biology of this key prey species. Therefore, restoration project /306 was established to work in coordination with restoration APEX project /163M to help characterize the relationship between seabird population dynamics and forage fish abundance. 

Abstract: Distinct sand lance populations occur within the relatively small geographic area of Lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. Marked meso-scale differences in abundance, growth, and mortality exist as a consequence of differing oceanographic regimes. Growth rate within populations (between years) was positively correlated with temperature. However, this did not extend to inter-population comparisons where differing growth rates were better correlated to marine productivity. Most sand lance reached maturity in their second year. Field observations and indices of maturity, gonad development, and ova-size distribution all indicated that sand lance spawn once each year. Sand lance spawned intertidally in late September and October on fine gravel/sandy beaches. Embryos developed over 67 days through periods of intertidal exposure and sub-freezing air temperatures. Mean dry-weight energy value of sand lance cycles seasonally, peaking in spring and early summer, and subsequently declining by about 25% during late summer and fall. Sand lance enter the winter with close to their minimum whole body energy content.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

The catch data is referenced by date, time of day, latitude and longitude. This was a feasibility study and contains catch data from 1 purse seine set on 1 day.  This is the only test of the mortality of juvenile pink salmon captured in the marine environment and tagged with PIT tags documented in the primary or gray literature as of 2005. The goal of this project was to evaluate the use of PIT tags as a second mark on otolith thermal marked juvenile hatchery pink salmon. The mortality could then be evaluated separately for early marine and the open ocean phases of the pink salmon life cycle.  Also included are water temperature and slainity data for the water in which the juvenile pink salmon were held during the short term mortality test. Data on tag detection in a adult pink salmon in a processing plant and detector configurations are also included. The fish were captured on 7/6/2005 at 17:51 GMT and tagging was complete by 01:59 on 7/7/2005 GMT. The fish were held on board the ADFG vessel R/V Solstice in an insulated fish tote until the study ended after 96 hours (7/11/2005 @ 02:00 GMT).

Survival to 96 hours was 92.5% (185 of 200), but 2 more fish had injuries that would have caused mortality. A lack of tagging experience  probably increased the mortality because 6 of 15 mortalities were in the first 25 fish tagged.  Examination of processing plants in Cordova for locations to scan for tags in returning adult pink salmon indicated  that changes in the plant would be necessary to get acceptable detection probabilities. Detection tests in August 2005 at one processing plant in Cordova supported that assessment.  Detection probabilities from three tests (n=51 tagged fish) were 0.14, 0.24, and 0.06.  Changes to processing lines to reduce the amount of metal would be required to get acceptable detection rates.

"319","df35d.222.12","urn:node:GOA","Subtidal Study Number 2B was initiated as part of a detailed study plan in 1989 under AirlWater Study Number 2 (Petroleum Hydrocarbon-Induced Injury to Subtidal Marine Sediment Resources). In 1991, the project was reclassified as Subtidal Study Number 2 and renamed (Injury to Benthic Communities) and had distinct shallow tidal and deep tidal project objectives. In 1992, the two elements were split into separate project numbers 2A (Injury to Shallow Benthic Communities and 2B (Deep Water Benthos). 

This study was designed to assess the possible injury by petroleum, derived from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to benthic infaunal resources within Prince William Sound in water deeper than 20 m. The sampling plan was developed to coordinate with several other concurrent programs within Prince William Sound. Analyses of benthic biological data collected from 14 bays in Prince William Sound in 1990 at 40, 100 and > 100 m, by univariate and multivariate techniques, demonstrated no obvious disturbance effects on the benthic biota 16 months after the oil spill. In all multivariate analyses, the major environmental variables related to the composition of benthic assemblages were sediment parameters such as percent silt, clay, mud, percent water and amount of nitrogen and carbon in sediment. Although limited amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons and presence of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were detected at some sites at 40 and 100 m in 1989 and 1990, minor or no impact was sustained by benthic fauna of the deep benthos within the Sound. It is apparent that the current speed within Prince William Sound during the oil spill was sufficient to flush out toxic fractions of the oil spill before they could damage the fauna within the deep benthos.

Recent declines of upper trophic level species in the northern Gulf of Alaska have been linked to decreasing availability of forage fishes. Sand lance is the most important forage fish in most nearshore areas of the northern Gulf. Despite its importance to commercial fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, little is known or published on the basic biology of this key prey species. Therefore, restoration project /306 was established to work in coordination with restoration APEX project /163M to help characterize the relationship between seabird population dynamics and forage fish abundance. 

Abstract: Distinct sand lance populations occur within the relatively small geographic area of Lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. Marked meso-scale differences in abundance, growth, and mortality exist as a consequence of differing oceanographic regimes. Growth rate within populations (between years) was positively correlated with temperature. However, this did not extend to inter-population comparisons where differing growth rates were better correlated to marine productivity. Most sand lance reached maturity in their second year. Field observations and indices of maturity, gonad development, and ova-size distribution all indicated that sand lance spawn once each year. Sand lance spawned intertidally in late September and October on fine gravel/sandy beaches. Embryos developed over 67 days through periods of intertidal exposure and sub-freezing air temperatures. Mean dry-weight energy value of sand lance cycles seasonally, peaking in spring and early summer, and subsequently declining by about 25% during late summer and fall. Sand lance enter the winter with close to their minimum whole body energy content.

Previous laboratory or hatchery studies demonstrate that resistance of eggs to mechanical damage increases with maturity, but applicability to natural populations requires an understanding of embryo age distributions and the ability to discriminate between sampler-induced egg mortality and natural mortality. Resistance of naturally spawned eggs to hydraulic shock, determined six times between late September and mid-November in a southeastern Alaska stream, increased sigmoidally from less than 2% to 98%. In contrast, the number of eggs that died from natural causes was unrelated to sample time. Rapid removal of all eggs from the water allowed accurate discrimination between shocked and eggs dead prior to sampling, an improved method we recommend for future studies. The rate of shock resistance increase was slower in naturally spawned eggs than in uniform-age embryos subjected to the same hydraulic shock. We caution that combining shocked and dead eggs into one 'dead' category does not accurately describe natural mortality.

After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, many researchers began measuring hydrocarbon concentrations in mussels, sediment, and other matrices in Prince William Sound to assess resource damage. The specific focus of this project was dense aggregations of intertidal mussels (Mytilus trossulus) within the slick trajectory. Oil accumulated in these filter-feeders; total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were high in 1989 and remained relatively high for several years in mussel beds on unconsolidated sediment. The persistence of oil in these beds in Prince William Sound and along the Gulf of Alaska caused concern, and beginning in 1992 heavily oiled beds were systematically surveyed for oil content in mussel tissue and underlying sediment. Projections from earlier data (through 1995) were that oil would persist for up to three decades, thus funding for study was extended through 1999. This report synthesizes all available natural resource damage assessment data (17 independent studies) to develop a coherent picture of spatial and temporal oil distributions in mussels and sediment.

Abstract: 
Exxon Valdez oil trapped in intertidal sediment in Prince William Sound degraded slowly, was biologically available for at least a decade, and was toxic for at least 9 years. Habitat condition controlled the biological availability of oil. Exposure duration was short where mussels were only exposed to oil in water (months) and long (6 to 10 years) at locations where oil remained in sediment. Limited evidence suggests some oiling extended outside previously reported slick boundaries; polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sources were verified with three independent petrogenic composition models. After an initial peak, oil concentrations typically declined in sediment and mussels, although distribution was non-uniform and variability was often high. Oil may persist in some intertidal sediment for >50 years, but declines in mussel tissue suggest it became less available to surface organisms and this community is recovering. Attempts to manually accelerate hydrocarbon loss from mussel beds were equivocal, demonstrating that removal of oil from intertidal sediment is difficult. Exposure to residual oil may explain why some vertebrate populations (pigeon guillemots, Cepphus columba, and sea otters, Enhydra lutris) that forage in the most heavily impacted areas have not yet fully recovered from the spill.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Between 23 June and 4 September Pratt Museum and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff worked in the museum with the cameras as public interpreters and data collectors. They helped teach nearly 15,000 visitors about seabirds, predator-prey relationships, habitat, and scientific research. Productivity data for a selected study plot was collected by camera at the museum and by observers in the field using binoculars and telescopes. Comparison of data sets revealed variations between data from camera and field observations. With camera observation fewer murres were counted, adult postures more frequently misidentified, eggs and chicks less frequently seen, and different hatch dates recorded. Calculated results for measures of
productivity were similar between the two methods, however. Public interaction with interpreter/data collectors greatly enhanced education and outreach but may have been one factor responsible for variation between camera-derived and field-derived data. Electronic interference, problems of hardware/software design, and delayed field maintenance were among other factors influencing camera effectiveness. These data include raw counts only and do not include vistitor participation data.

Data indicated that LWC contained significant amounts of spawning habitat that were underutilized by pink and coho salmon due to an ineffective barrier bypass structure. The project priorities were to renovate the bypass to reduce gradients and design resting pools to minimize water velocity. The bypass renovation was completed in the fall 1995; bypass gradients were reduced from 27% to 17-20% and two additional resting pools and an entrance pool were installed. The steeppass sections were staggered between pools to reduce the velocity of stream flows. The historical performance of the three bypasses at LWC, since installation in 1981, has been significant, increasing average pink salmon escapements from -7,000 to -70,000 fish. The number of pink salmon migrating by way of all three bypasses to spawn in upstream habitat has significantly increased resultant returns; however, regression analysis was driven by the large upstream escapement in 1993. The historical proportion of the total annual pink salmon escapement to migrate upstream has primarily been a function of the design and performance of the largest (most upstream) bypass.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

Earlier studies stated that there are only a few streams in Prince William Sound with these species, but after consultation with local residents, it appeared these fish were more widespread than previously believed. Given these uncertainties, we consulted local residents, government agencies, Native groups, and other knowledgeable individuals to determine where these species could be found. Streams and lake systems were surveyed by field crews to determine the presence or absence of these species. We found 29 lakes and streams which had undocumented populations of these and other anadromous fish species. The number of undocumented populations by species were as follows: 23 Dolly Varden, 21 cutthroat trout, 14 coho salmon (O. kisutch), two sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and one chum salmon (O. keta). Six resident Dolly Varden and six resident cutthroat trout populations were also identified. The results of this study are being used to update the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, or Migration of Anadromous Fishes, (Anadromous Waters Catalog) and assist the research being conducted under EVOS project 96145.

"331","doi:10.5063/F1X63JTD","urn:node:GOA","Harlequin ducks have been studied extensively in Prince William Sound during the restoration phase following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, leading to one of the most thorough considerations of wildlife population injury and recovery following a major oil spill ever undertaken. These efforts have included population monitoring by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as a series of directed research projects designed to elucidate the process of, and constraints to, population recovery. These studies demonstrated that harlequin ducks were exposed to lingering oil over a much longer time frame (i.e., through at least 2005, 16 years following the spill) than expected at the time of the spill, based on elevated levels of cytochrome P4501A induction in birds from oiled areas. In addition, several lines of evidence suggested that population injury occurred through at least 1998. Specifically, female winter survival probabilities were found to differ between oiled and unoiled areas, and densities were shown to be lower in oiled than unoiled areas after accounting for habitat-related effects. More recent data have indicated that female winter survival did not differ between oiled and unoiled sites during 2000-03, suggesting that direct effects of oil exposure on demographic properties may have abated.
In response to the data described above, the work here was proposed to add to the existing cytochrome P4501A monitoring data to track the timeline of exposure to lingering oil, and to assemble the demographic data collected during previous restoration studies into a quantitative population model to allow consideration of the timing and magnitude of oil spill injury, the mechanisms by which injury occurred and population recovery was constrained, and the current status of recovery, including predictions for timing of full recovery.

 FINDINGS: We found that cytochrome P4501A induction during winters 2005, 2006-07, and 2009 was higher in harlequin ducks captured in areas of Prince William Sound oiled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, relative to unoiled areas. Cytochrome P4501A induction did not vary in relation to age, sex, or mass of individuals, nor did it vary strongly by season in samples collected early and late in the winter. We interpret these results to indicate that harlequin ducks continued to be exposed to residual Exxon Valdez oil up to 20 years after the original spill. Population modeling efforts indicated that female mortality related to chronic exposure to lingering oil was nearly double that estimated during the acute phase (the weeks and months immediately post-spill). Full recovery to pre-spill numbers was estimated to require between 13 and 32 years, with the most likely recovery scenario requiring roughly 24 years. Taken together, the data presented in this report add to a growing body of literature suggesting that effects of oil spills on wildlife have the potential to be expressed over much longer time frames than previously assumed.

Phase I was conducted in summer 1989/spring 1990 and involved site selection/ground truthing. Phase II involved intensive evaluation of study sites to determine extent of injury to natural resources in supratidal, intertidal and subtidal areas. Phase II commenced in the fall of 1989 and continued through the summer of 1991. The supratidal component was completed in 1991 and a final report was submitted separately. The subtidal portion was integrated into a suite of other subtidal studies and findings were also reported separately. Draft preliminary status reports were issued for the intertidal componenet in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 by Highsmith et al. as Coastal Habitat Study No. 1: Phase II in 1990 and 1991 and No. 1A in 1992 and 1993.

Abstract: The Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment Study was initiated to assess injury to intertidal habitats impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The study, conducted from 1989-1991, encompassed three major geographical areas impacted by the spill: Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet-Kenia Peninsula and Kodiak-Alaska Peninsula. Oiled sites were selected randomly and matched with non-oiled sites and classified into sheltered rocky, exposed rocky, coarse textured or estuarine habitat. Statistically significant differences between oiled and non-oiled sites were interpreted as impact due to the spill and/or clean-up activities. Most observed differences varied across regions, habitats and tidal heights. Algae, especially the perennial Fucus, was generally negatively impacted on oiled sites. Conversely, an increase in annual and ephemeral species in the lower intertidal occurred. Limpets, mussels, littorines, and the high cockscomb prickleback were injured by the spill, while oligochaetes and a single barnacle species were enhanced at most tidal heights following the spill. Although intertidal communities showed widespread impact from oiling/clean-up activities for algal, invertebrate and fish components, data revealed most habitats were recovering but had fully recovered by 1991.

The Data Inventory contains information about each spatial data theme, including a title/description of the data file, a link to the associated metadata record, and a sample thematic map. The ""thematic map"" for each image theme is simply a low-resolution version of the image, while the ""thematic maps"" for feature and grid themes generally display one particular attribute of the spatial data, keeping in mind that most themes have multiple attributes associated with them that are not displayed.

 The KBEC GIS layers pertain to the physical environment, the estuarine environment, the terrestrial environment and also contains information about scores of plant and animal species that occur in the vicinity of Kachemak Bay to supplement multiple sections of the narrative. Additionally, layers cover social data including an historical perspectie of Kachemak Bay  and a present-day perspective of human uses.

In general, these maps do not distinguish ubiquitous and/or wide-ranging species. Instead, the focus is on species with special habitat requirements provided by the areas in and around the Kachemak Bay Watershed. These maps are not comprehensive, but they do represent the current state of knowledge. They, therefore, help to illuminate the strengths and gaps in our collective knowledge base. Recall that detailed information on sources, coverage, etc. of the data layers can be found in the metadata.

In Prince William Sound (PWS) adult herring disperse after spawning, however their movement patterns are poorly understood. Acoustic telemetry is a tool used to track fish to understand more about their seasonal movements. This project (EVOS project numbers: 12120111-B, 13120111-B, 14120111-B) tested the utility of acoustic tags for tracking the seasonal migrations of adult herring into and out of PWS. In April 2012 and 2013 adult herring were captured on their spawning grounds in Port Gravina (northeast PWS) using jigs. The herring were then sedated, measured and a small acoustic tag surgically implanted. In 2012 25 herring were acoustically tagged, and 69 herring were tagged in 2013. Post release tagged herring were monitored by acoustic receiver arrays with two receivers located near the entrance to Port Gravina (on the eastern and western side) through 19 May 2012, when data was uploaded. In 2013, coverage in Port Gravina was expanded and included an array of nine receivers. Receivers were deployed in Port Gravina from 7-8 April through 21 May 2013 when receivers were removed. As part of the Ocean Tracking network (www.oceantrackingnetwork.org), receiver arrays were also deployed across the principal entrances into the Sound from the Gulf of Alaska during March 2013. Arrays were located at Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and the four southwest passages in Prince William Sound. Data from the Ocean Tracking Network arrays were uploaded in February and May 2014, after transmitters had expired. Tag life on transmitters was estimated at ~ 263 days. This dataset contains four comma-separated values (csv) files each containing the tagging log and acoustic receiver detection log for each tagging year (e.g. 2012 and 2013). The files named 'Herring Tagging Log' describe the length and weight measurements and spawning-state characteristics for each acoustic tagged fish. The files named 'AcousticTaggedHerringDetections' are acoustic receiver detection logs containing the data, time, and location of tagged herring detections. Ocean Tracking Network Array Expansion, 2016 In 2013, we documented post-spawn migration of herring from Port Gravina to the PWS entrances by acoustic tagging adult herring and collecting data from the Ocean Tracking Network acoustic arrays. The 2013 study, however, could not verify if herring were migrating out into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and then returning to PWS because of the single-line layout of the Ocean Tracking Network arrays. The February 2017 acoustic array expansion created a double-line of receivers in known areas of high traffic by herring at the Ocean Tracking Network. This will allow PWSSC researchers to document adult herring migration movements out from and into PWS, and to better understand factors that influence migration patterns including age, condition, spawning location, and residency in PWS. The dataset contains one csv file containing array location, station name, deploy latitude, deploy longitude, and deploy depth for the receivers deployed during February 2017 as part of project 16160111-S.","Tracking Seasonal Movements of Adult Pacific Herring in Prince William Sound, 2012-2016, EVOS Herring Program.

In Prince William Sound (PWS) adult herring disperse after spawning, however their movement patterns are poorly understood. Acoustic telemetry is a tool used to track fish to understand more about their seasonal movements. This project (EVOS project numbers: 12120111-B, 13120111-B, 14120111-B) tested the utility of acoustic tags for tracking the seasonal migrations of adult herring into and out of PWS. In April 2012 and 2013 adult herring were captured on their spawning grounds in Port Gravina (northeast PWS) using jigs. The herring were then sedated, measured and a small acoustic tag surgically implanted. In 2012 25 herring were acoustically tagged, and 69 herring were tagged in 2013. Post release tagged herring were monitored by acoustic receiver arrays with two receivers located near the entrance to Port Gravina (on the eastern and western side) through 19 May 2012, when data was uploaded. In 2013, coverage in Port Gravina was expanded and included an array of nine receivers. Receivers were deployed in Port Gravina from 7-8 April through 21 May 2013 when receivers were removed. As part of the Ocean Tracking network (www.oceantrackingnetwork.org), receiver arrays were also deployed across the principal entrances into the Sound from the Gulf of Alaska during March 2013. Arrays were located at Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and the four southwest passages in Prince William Sound. Data from the Ocean Tracking Network arrays were uploaded in February and May 2014, after transmitters had expired. Tag life on transmitters was estimated at ~ 263 days. This dataset contains four comma-separated values (csv) files each containing the tagging log and acoustic receiver detection log for each tagging year (e.g. 2012 and 2013).

The files named 'AcousticTaggedHerringDetections' are acoustic receiver detection logs containing the data, time, and location of tagged herring detections. Ocean Tracking Network Array Expansion, 2016 In 2013, we documented post-spawn migration of herring from Port Gravina to the PWS entrances by acoustic tagging adult herring and collecting data from the Ocean Tracking Network acoustic arrays. The 2013 study, however, could not verify if herring were migrating out into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and then returning to PWS because of the single-line layout of the Ocean Tracking Network arrays. The February 2017 acoustic array expansion created a double-line of receivers in known areas of high traffic by herring at the Ocean Tracking Network. This will allow PWSSC researchers to document adult herring migration movements out from and into PWS, and to better understand factors that influence migration patterns including age, condition, spawning location, and residency in PWS. The dataset contains one csv file containing array location, station name, deploy latitude, deploy longitude, and deploy depth for the receivers deployed during February 2017 as part of project 16160111-S.","Tracking Seasonal Movements of Adult Pacific Herring in Prince William Sound, 2012-2016, EVOS Herring Program.

Gulf Watch Alaska is the long-term ecosystem monitoring program of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council for the marine ecosystem affected by the 1989 oil spill. This dataset contains two types of comma-separated values (csv) files: CPR category files, describing abundances of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa retained by a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) during 2012 to 2016; and temperature files, which are water temperature measurement from a logger attached to the CPR. Data files are organized by year from 2011 to 2016. There are no 2011 plankton data in this collection but CPR data have been collected since 1997. Refer to Related Resource for cross reference to the longer timeseries plankton dataset. These data were collected to describe the plankton populations of the North Pacific and to monitor their distribution and abundance over multiple years. The CPR collected plankton samples as it was towed behind a merchant ship on a transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK, from 2012 to 2016, and water temperature data from a logger attached to the CPR. The CPR has sampled this transect monthly from spring through summer since 2004. There are also data from 2000-2003 from a previous transect. The current transect intersects with the outer part of the Seward Line and provides complementary large scale data to compare with the more local, finer scale plankton sampling on the shelf and in Prince William Sound (PWS). As part of the larger continuous dataset, several transects were occupied during 1997, and from 2000-2016. The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km).

Surveys were conducted during the night, when herring are known to come near the surface (which makes them more accessible to hydroacoustic methods), using a BioSonics 124 kHz digital split-beam transducer mounted down-looking on an aluminum towfin. The dataset consists of intermediary files (in CSV format) of acoustic backscatter outputted by the Echoview program in the form of the area backscatter coefficient (sa, m2 m-2) from raw acoustic source data files (in *.DT4 format). While the time series of acoustic data dates back to 2007, this dataset represents only years 2012-2015 for which full acoustic analysis has been completed. The analysis excludes Windy Bay due to low catches of herring. Subsurface trawls were used to collect fish to determine the mix of fish present during each hydroacoustic survey. The length, weight, and age estimation of captured fish are included in a related dataset entitled: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring, 2010-2016: EVOS Herring Program.","Acoustic Juvenile Herring Abundance Data, Prince William Sound, 2012-2015, EVOS Herring Program","Pete Rand"

The purpose of this study was to examine the genetic stock structure of herring within PWS and the connections to herring stocks outside of PWS. Herring were collected from 2012 to 2015 in eastern and western PWS, and several locations adjacent to PWS, including Southeast Alaska, Yakutat and Kayak Island, Cook Inlet, Shelikof Strait, and Kodiak Island for genetic analysis. Bering Sea herring collected from 2005 to 2008 were included as outliers. This dataset is a single comma-separated values (csv) file containing genetic information obtained from thirteen microsatellite loci and mtDNA cytochrome b (cytb) sequences. Genetic analyses was conducted at the NOAA- Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories in Juneau, Alaska. Analyses of the microsatellite loci show that allele frequencies of herring collections in eastern PWS are homogenous among bays, between year classes, and over years. Collections from Montague Island and Evans Island (western PWS) indicated a weak signal of differentiation from eastern PWS collections. PWS herring are genetically similar to herring east of PWS (Kayak Island and Yakutat), but are significantly different than herring west of PWS (Kodiak, Cook Inlet, and Shelikof Strait).

Locations were calculated by the ARGOS system, and the resulting output is listed in these .xls spreadsheets. The resident killer whale is a genetically and behaviorally distinct ecotype of killer whale (Orcinus orca) that feeds primarily on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). Details regarding habitat use have been inferred by boat surveys, but are subject to effort bias and weather limitations. To investigate use of habitat, 33 resident killer whales representing 14 pods in the Northern Gulf of Alaska were tagged with satellite transmitters from 2004 to 2014, and transmissions were received during the months of June to January. Core use areas were identified through utilization distributions using a biased Brownian Bridge movement model. Distinct shifts in these core use areas were revealed that are highly specific to season and pod. In June, July, and August, the waters of Hinchinbrook Entrance and west of Kayak Island were primary areas used, mainly by the AB, AI, and AJ pods. These same pods shifted their focus to Montague Strait in August, September, and October. Port Gravina was a focal area for the AD16 and AK pods in June, July, and August, but this was not the case in later months. AK and AD16 pods were responsible for seven of eight documented trips into the deeper fjords of Prince William Sound, though these fjords were not a focus for most groups. These temporal shifts in habitat use are likely a response to the seasonal returns of salmon, though details on specific migration routes and timing for these fishes are limited. We found strong seasonal and pod-specific shifts in patterns among core use areas. Future research should investigate pod differences in diet composition and relationships between core area use and bathymetry.","Prince William Sound Killer Whale Satellite Telemetry Data, 2004 to 2016, Gulf Watch Alaska Pelagic Component","Craig Matkin"

Flying 1000 feet in the air, following the contours of the Prince William Sound shoreline, schools of juvenile herring are easily identified and measured during the long summer days. Surveying from the air has the benefit of covering a large geographic area while minimizing the disturbance of herring. Aerial surveys cover waters that are too shallow for acoustic survey vessels to access. Aerial surveys were conducted from 2010 to 2012 during the months of June, July, and August as part of the PWS Herring Survey program by Evelyn Brown (EVOSTC project number 10100132-F). Beginning in 2013 (under EVOSTC projects 12120111-O, 14120111-R, and 16120111-O) surveys have been conducted in June focused on age-1 herring and in July in support of the project entitled Forage Fish Distribution, Abundance, and Body Condition in Prince William Sound, 2012-2015: Gulf Watch Alaska Pelagic Component (EVOSTC projects 12120114-O, 14120114-O, and 16120114-O). Each monthly survey takes about 10 to 12 days, 3 to 5 hours each day, in a Cessna 185 float plane. This dataset is a comma-separated value (csv) file containing the total number of age-1 herring schools by size (small, medium, large, and x-large) as determined from the 2010-2017 aerial surveys. When multiple surveys of an area were conducted only the first set of observations were used in the calculation of numbers of schools. During the course of the survey, the aerial flight tracks, numbers of fish schools, species of fish, school size, marine mammals, marine birds, and notes about unusual oceanographic sightings were recorded electronically and on paper. The raw aerial survey data files (csvs, gpx flightlogs, shapefile flightlogs, text notes and photos) are available from the Principal Investigator upon request. Formats of the raw datasets changed over the years of the survey (refer to Usability Report section) and include related files containing time, location, school extent, number of schools, species, herring estimated age, and observations of whales (orca, humpback, minke, grey, and fin).

Fisheries managers use population models to determine the level of commercial fishing to allow annually. These models are based on the number of fish observed during the spawning period. However, this method fails to count a portion of the younger fish, because they do not participate in the spawn. This project, conducted from 2012 to 2015, aimed to improve the estimate of the total herring population by examining the percent of fish of various ages that join the herring stock after the spawning period. Using a captive population of wild adult herring, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Juneau, Alaska conducted a lab study to assess the feasibility of identifying whether individual herring were immature (have never spawned), primiparous (have spawned only once), or repeat spawners. Researchers tested whether the age at first spawn could be determined by analyzing the history of egg development in the ovaries (histology), or by using growth increments on herring scales (which is a less expensive method). This dataset is six comma-separated value (csv) files. Three files relate to the laboratory component of the study, including water temperature herring were reared in (EVOSTC_Project 13120111-I_Primiparous Herring_Final_2011_lab_water_temp.csv), photoperiod during the laboratory experiment (EVOSTC_Project 13120111-I_Primiparous Herring_Final_2011_lab_photoperiod.csv), and results of histological analysis of post-spawn herring, as well as biological characteristics of those fish (gender, fork length, mass, and gonadosomatic index; EVOSTC_Project 13120111-I_Primiparous Herring_Final_2011_lab_histology.csv).

Past research of juvenile Pacific herring in PWS has shown that recruitment is highly influenced by conditions within nursery sites affecting survival within the first year. Important among these factors is the pre-winter condition of juvenile (age-0) herring and the effects of water temperatures on their metabolism. Studies of the physical oceanography of nursery fjords during the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program indicate that each site has a unique set of hydrographic conditions that are influenced by both local processes and water exchange between the Gulf of Alaska and PWS. These factors vary significantly depending on geographic location, basin morphometry, watershed topography and proximity to sources of glacial water. This dataset includes the following: 1) temperature and salinity data collected by moored and profiled CTDs; and 2) thermistors strung at specific depth intervals on the moorings. The data were collected from 2010 to 2012, and built upon a 2007-2008 study funded by the EVOSTC (entitled Physical Oceanographic Factors Affecting Productivity in Juvenile Pacific Herring Nursery Habitats, EVOS project numbers: 070817, 080817, 090817) by continuing a hydrographic time series within the four principal PWS nursery fjords: Simpson Bay, Eaglek Bay, Whale Bay, and Zaikof Bay. The data are given in ASCII format, which can be read by any type of text viewing software, such as UNIX based Awk or Generic Mapping Tool (GMT), data visualization and spreadsheet software such as Matlab and Excel, and Microsoft programs such as Notepad and Wordpad. The data are in both raw and processed forms, the latter including quality checking, data reduction and averaging (where appropriate). The CTDs include an SB19plus for profiles, and SB16.03s, SB37s and an SB19.03 for moored data.

As part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132), from March 2010 through March 2012 castnets and gillnets were deployed in bays of Prince William Sound to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March. In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations.

Gulf Watch Alaska is the long-term ecosystem monitoring program of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council for the marine ecosystem affected by the 1989 oil spill. Beginning in March 2007, monitoring of marine bird abundance, distribution, species composition, and habitat associations commenced using multiple surveys during fall and winter (September-March). Data was collected under three separate EVOS-funded projects each with different objectives. Refer to funding chronology under Supplemental Information for project-specific objectives. In particular, this dataset contains marine bird observation data in Prince William Sound (PWS) from 2007-2017. The dataset includes 11 comma-separated value (csv) files exported from the marine bird and mammal observation software dLOG (Ford Consulting, Inc., Portland OR 1999) for each winter the survey was conducted (March 2007, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2016/17). Depending on the winter and project, marine bird observations were collected in September, October, November, December, January, February, and March. All marine bird observations were conducted using established U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) protocols (USFWS 2007). Except for the March 2007 survey, all surveys record number of birds sighted by observers within a strip transect width of 300 m (150 m both sides and ahead of the boat, in 3 distance bins of 50 m) made by a research vessel. In March 2007, the strip-width was 200 m. The observer recorded observations into a laptop computer integrated with a global positioning system (GPS) using the program Dlog. The GPS-integrated program provided location data at 15-sec intervals and for every entered observation. Because surveys were conducted in conjunction with different research programs, observations were typically conducted under one of two scenarios: while boats were transiting between areas or, in the case of juvenile herring surveys, observations were conducted in juvenile herring survey bays along a zigzag track, approximately 200 m or greater from shore that coincides with the same transect line as the nocturnal hydroacoustic juvenile herring surveys. In the later years, the project expanded from placing bird observers on-board EVOS-sponsored PWS Science Center juvenile herring surveys and NOAA Humpback Whale surveys to include two additional ships of opportunity as observation platforms. These include: Alaska Department of Fish and Game spot-shrimp cruise and the Ocean Tracking Network maintenance cruise.","Fall and Winter Seabird Abundance Data, Prince William Sound, 2007-2017, Gulf Watch Alaska Pelagic Component","Mary Anne Bishop"

Longlines were set near schools of herring located during hydroacoustic surveys conducted the previous day. For all six cruises we supplemented information on potential predators using variable-mesh gill nets placed perpendicular to shore. For each cruise, we collected up to 30 individuals of each species captured from the combined longline and gill net sets in the sampled bay. Fish were measured (TL, mm) and weighed (g) prior to removal of stomachs for dietary analyses. Stomach contents were analyzed in the laboratory to determine diet composition. Gut contents were sorted into gross taxonomic categories, enumerated and weighed (g). All fish prey items (fish tissue, otoliths and bones such as jaws, vertebrae, etc. as well as partially and fully intact fish prey) were shipped to a second laboratory. There fish were identified to species, estimated to size from hard parts based on published regressions, and counted.","Fish Predation on Juvenile Herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 2009-2012, EVOS Prince William Sound Herring Program","Mary Anne Bishop"

Specifically, these data provide a measure of juvenile herring abundance in Prince William Sound to predict future additions to the spawning stock. Hydroacoustic (sonar) surveys were conducted each November from 2012 to 2016 in eight bays around Prince William Sound to estimate the abundance of juvenile herring (focusing on age-0 fish). This effort is a continuation of similar juvenile herring acoustic surveys conducted in twelve locations within Prince William Sound during fall (November) and winters (March), 2007 to 2012. Surveys were conducted during the night, when herring are known to come near the surface (which makes them more accessible to hydroacoustic methods), using a BioSonics 124 kHz digital split-beam transducer mounted down-looking on an aluminum towfin.

In Prince William Sound (PWS) adult herring disperse after spawning, however their movement patterns are poorly understood. Acoustic telemetry is a tool used to track fish to understand more about their seasonal movements. This project (EVOS project numbers: 12120111-B, 13120111-B, 14120111-B) tested the utility of acoustic tags for tracking the seasonal migrations of adult herring into and out of PWS. In April 2012 and 2013 adult herring were captured on their spawning grounds in Port Gravina (northeast PWS) using jigs. The herring were then sedated, measured and a small acoustic tag surgically implanted. In 2012 25 herring were acoustically tagged, and 69 herring were tagged in 2013. Post release tagged herring were monitored by acoustic receiver arrays with two receivers located near the entrance to Port Gravina (on the eastern and western side) through 19 May 2012, when data was uploaded. In 2013, coverage in Port Gravina was expanded and included an array of nine receivers. Receivers were deployed in Port Gravina from 7-8 April through 21 May 2013 when receivers were removed. As part of the Ocean Tracking network (www.oceantrackingnetwork.org), receiver arrays were also deployed across the principal entrances into the Sound from the Gulf of Alaska during March 2013. Arrays were located at Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and the four southwest passages in Prince William Sound. Data from the Ocean Tracking Network arrays were uploaded in February and May 2014, after transmitters had expired. Tag life on transmitters was estimated at ~ 263 days. This dataset contains four comma-separated values (csv) files each containing the tagging log and acoustic receiver detection log for each tagging year (e.g. 2012 and 2013). The files named 'Herring Tagging Log' describe the length and weight measurements and spawning-state characteristics for each acoustic tagged fish. The files named 'AcousticTaggedHerringDetections' are acoustic receiver detection logs containing the data, time, and location of tagged herring detections. Ocean Tracking Network Array Expansion, 2016 In 2013, we documented post-spawn migration of herring from Port Gravina to the PWS entrances by acoustic tagging adult herring and collecting data from the Ocean Tracking Network acoustic arrays. The 2013 study, however, could not verify if herring were migrating out into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and then returning to PWS because of the single-line layout of the Ocean Tracking Network arrays. The February 2017 acoustic array expansion created a double-line of receivers in known areas of high traffic by herring at the Ocean Tracking Network. This will allow PWSSC researchers to document adult herring migration movements out from and into PWS, and to better understand factors that influence migration patterns including age, condition, spawning location, and residency in PWS. The dataset contains one csv file containing array location, station name, deploy latitude, deploy longitude, and deploy depth for the receivers deployed during February 2017 as part of project 16160111-S.","Tracking Seasonal Movements of Adult Pacific Herring in Prince William Sound, 2012-2016, EVOS Herring Program.

Pacific herring in PWS have been classified as ""not-recovered"" by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC). Predation by marine mammals has been cited as a factor in the failure of this population to rebound. Following protocols established during the winters of 2007/08 and 2008/09(EVOSTC project PJ090804), the seasonal trends and abundance of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in PWS were examined from 2012 to 2016. Prey selection by humpback whales was determined through acoustic surveys, visual observation, scat analysis and prey sampling. Chemical analysis of blubber samples (stable isotopes and fatty acid analysis) were collected to provide a longer term perspective on whale diet and shifts in prey type. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed by whales, with the long term goal of enhancing the age structure modeling of population with better estimates of predation mortality.

The resident killer whale is a genetically and behaviorally distinct ecotype of killer whale (Orcinus orca) that feeds primarily on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). Details regarding habitat use have been inferred by boat surveys, but are subject to effort bias and weather limitations. To investigate use of habitat, 33 resident killer whales representing 14 pods in the Northern Gulf of Alaska were tagged with satellite transmitters from 2004 to 2014, and transmissions were received during the months of June to January. Core use areas were identified through utilization distributions using a biased Brownian Bridge movement model. Distinct shifts in these core use areas were revealed that are highly specific to season and pod. In June, July, and August, the waters of Hinchinbrook Entrance and west of Kayak Island were primary areas used, mainly by the AB, AI, and AJ pods. These same pods shifted their focus to Montague Strait in August, September, and October. Port Gravina was a focal area for the AD16 and AK pods in June, July, and August, but this was not the case in later months. AK and AD16 pods were responsible for seven of eight documented trips into the deeper fjords of Prince William Sound, though these fjords were not a focus for most groups. These temporal shifts in habitat use are likely a response to the seasonal returns of salmon, though details on specific migration routes and timing for these fishes are limited. We found strong seasonal and pod-specific shifts in patterns among core use areas.

As part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132), from March 2010 through March 2012 castnets and gillnets were deployed in bays of Prince William Sound to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March. In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations. A list of these projects and the associated EVOS project numbers is provided in Supplemental Information.","Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring, 2010-2016: EVOS Herring Program","Mary Anne Bishop"

Past research of juvenile Pacific herring in PWS has shown that recruitment is highly influenced by conditions within nursery sites affecting survival within the first year. Important among these factors is the pre-winter condition of juvenile (age-0) herring and the effects of water temperatures on their metabolism. Studies of the physical oceanography of nursery fjords during the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program indicate that each site has a unique set of hydrographic conditions that are influenced by both local processes and water exchange between the Gulf of Alaska and PWS. These factors vary significantly depending on geographic location, basin morphometry, watershed topography and proximity to sources of glacial water. This dataset includes the following: 1) temperature and salinity data collected by moored and profiled CTDs; and 2) thermistors strung at specific depth intervals on the moorings.

Fisheries managers use population models to determine the level of commercial fishing to allow annually. These models are based on the number of fish observed during the spawning period. However, this method fails to count a portion of the younger fish, because they do not participate in the spawn. This project, conducted from 2012 to 2015, aimed to improve the estimate of the total herring population by examining the percent of fish of various ages that join the herring stock after the spawning period. Using a captive population of wild adult herring, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Juneau, Alaska conducted a lab study to assess the feasibility of identifying whether individual herring were immature (have never spawned), primiparous (have spawned only once), or repeat spawners. Researchers tested whether the age at first spawn could be determined by analyzing the history of egg development in the ovaries (histology), or by using growth increments on herring scales (which is a less expensive method).

Described here is a single process study project that is a part of an integrative program that will enhance the current monitoring efforts, and examine aspects of particular life stages to allow better modeling of PWS herring populations. The long-term goal of the program is to improve predictive models of herring stocks through observations and research. Fine-scale temporal and spatial variability at designated herring monitoring sites has never been characterized and therefore remains a data gap with potential ramifications for interpreting observed variation of herring condition that is part of the herring monitoring program as well as the aforementioned modeling. The dataset archived here represent the Prince William Sound Science Center (PWSSC) component of the Juvenile Herring Intensive Condition Monitoring (HCM) project. The data are measures of age-0 herring morphology and energetic condition based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios and bomb calorimetry of fish sampled with high temporal and spatial resolution from nursery bays located throughout PWS during 2011 and 2012. To assess fine-scale temporal variability, herring were collected on research cruises in Simpson Bay (a key monitoring site for juvenile herring since the 1990’s) monthly from September 2011 until June 2012. To assess fine-scale spatial variability, sampling occurred in November and March, 2011 to 2012 in five separate sub-areas of a more extensive Simpson Bay than what is typically done during surveys. Samples were frozen and transported by to the Prince William Sounds Science Center in Cordova, Alaska for length and weight measurements and chemical analysis.

Gulf of Alaska marine species respond to estuary-shelf water gradients in temperature, salinity, stratification, and turbidity, as well as to changes in those parameters associated with short- and long-term climate variations. Shipboard oceanographic and plankton surveys were made along repeated transects from February 2012 to December 2016, with monthly sampling along a mid-Kachemak Bay transect, and quarterly seasonal sampling along an outer Kachemak Bay and three lower Cook Inlet transects. Oceanographic data were collected at vertical stations with conductivity-temperature vs depth (CTD) profilers (SeaBird Electronics 19plus), with vertical measurements of dissolved oxygen, turbidity, fluorescence, and light availability also made from attached sensors. CTD data were processed using SBE Data Processing software. Coincident with the oceanographic observations, zooplankton and phytoplankton net tows were conducted at three of the stations along each transect to identify spatial and seasonal patterns in plankton biomass and community composition, and to assess plankton community response to environmental changes. Opportunistic seabird and marine mammal observations were conducted during shipboard surveys, in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Migratory Bird Program.

The impact by humpback whales on Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) populations in Prince William Sound (PWS) were evaluated in this study. Pacific herring in PWS have been classified as ""not-recovered"" by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (EVOSTC). Predation by marine mammals has been cited as a factor in the failure of this population to rebound. Following protocols established during the winters of 2007/08 and 2008/09(EVOSTC project PJ090804), the seasonal trends and abundance of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in PWS were examined from 2012 to 2016. Prey selection by humpback whales was determined through acoustic surveys, visual observation, scat analysis and prey sampling. Chemical analysis of blubber samples (stable isotopes and fatty acid analysis) were collected to provide a longer term perspective on whale diet and shifts in prey type. These data will be combined in a bioenergetic model to determine numbers of herring consumed by whales, with the long term goal of enhancing the age structure modeling of population with better estimates of predation mortality. The native file format is a Microsoft Office Access 2007 database (12.0 6735.5000) containing the humpback whale surveys including survey effort, whale identification, photo quality, whale behavior, prey items and tissue samples.

GWA is the long-term ecosystem monitoring program of the EVOS for the marine ecosystem affected by the 1989 oil spill. Data were collected under multiple projects each with different objectives. Refer to funding chronology under Supplemental Information for project-specific objectives. All marine bird observations were conducted using established U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) protocols (USFWS 2007). Except for the March 2007 survey, all surveys record number of birds sighted by observers within a strip transect width of 300 m (150 m both sides and ahead of the boat, in 3 distance bins of 50 m) made by a research vessel. In March 2007, the strip-width was 200 m. The observer recorded observations into a laptop computer integrated with a global positioning system (GPS) using the program Dlog (2007 - March 2021) or SeaLog (September 2021-March 2022). These GPS-integrated programs provided location data at 15-sec intervals and for every entered observation. Because surveys were conducted in conjunction with different research programs, observations were typically conducted under one of two scenarios: while boats were transiting between areas or, in the case of juvenile herring surveys, observations were conducted in juvenile herring survey bays along a zigzag track, approximately 200 m or greater from shore that coincides with the same transect line as the nocturnal hydroacoustic juvenile herring surveys. In the later years, the project expanded from placing bird observers on-board EVOS-sponsored PWS Science Center juvenile herring surveys and NOAA Humpback Whale surveys to include two additional ships of opportunity as observation platforms. These include: Alaska Department of Fish and Game spot-shrimp cruise and the Ocean Tracking Network maintenance cruise.","Fall and Winter Seabird Abundance Data, Prince William Sound, 2007-2022, Gulf Watch Alaska Pelagic Component","Mary Anne Bishop"

Data files are organized by year from 2011 to 2020. There are no 2011 plankton data in this collection but CPR data have been collected since 1997. Refer to Related Resource for cross reference to the longer timeseries plankton dataset. These data were collected to describe the plankton populations of the North Pacific and to monitor their distribution and abundance over multiple years. The CPR collected plankton samples as it was towed behind a merchant ship on a transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK and water temperature data from a Brancker CTD-F attached to CPR. The CPR has sampled this transect monthly from spring through summer since 2004. There are also data from 2000-2003 from a previous transect. The current transect intersects with the outer part of the Seward Line and provides complementary large scale data to compare with the more local, finer scale plankton sampling on the shelf and in Prince William Sound (PWS). As part of the larger continuous dataset, several transects were occupied during 1997, and from 2000-2016. The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km).

The project is a continuation of Projects 14120111-B, “Tracking Seasonal Movements of Adult Pacific Herring in Prince William Sound” and 16160111-S “Annual Herring Migration Cycle: Expanding Acoustic Array Infrastructure”. Methodology and results from these two previous projects were used to perfect methods to acoustic-tag wild Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) captured in prespawning aggregations, to document postspawn herring movements, and to expand acoustic arrays at the Gulf of Alaska entrances to determine fish movement direction. In Prince William Sound (PWS) adult herring disperse after spawning, however their movement patterns are poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to document adult herring migration movements between spawning, summer feeding, and overwintering areas, including movements out from and into PWS and to better understand factors that influence migration patterns including biological (weight, length, condition, age) and environmental factors. Acoustic telemetry is a tool used to track fish to understand more about their seasonal movements. During April 2017-2020 adult herring were captured using jigs primarily on their spawning grounds in southeast PWS. Captured herring were then sedated, measured and a small acoustic tag surgically implanted. Fish tagged in 2019 and 2020 also had a scale removed for aging. Tag life on transmitters was estimated at ~8.5 months for smaller V8 tags and ~26 months or longer for the larger, V9 tags. We targeted fish weighing <100 g for the smaller V8 tags. In all 726 fish were acoustically tagged, including 714 on the southeast PWS spawning grounds and 12 at northern Montague Island (Rocky Bay). Detections of acoustic tagged fish were obtained over the period of April 2017 through May 2022 from a series of acoustic receiver arrays deployed throughout the Sound, including the southeast PWS spawning grounds, northern Montague Strait, Knight Island Passage, and the Ocean Tracking Network (www.oceantrackingnetwork.org) arrays located at the principal entrances to the Gulf of Alaska from Prince William Sound.

Since 1993 the Prince William Sound Science Center has annually conducted surveys of the spawning biomass using hydroacoustic techniques. This information can be used as a biomass index in the age-structure-analysis model for determining the population biomass. In most years the focus has been on the main spawning stock in eastern Prince William Sound (there are other smaller stocks in Prince William Sound that are not quantified). It is possible that fish spawning outside the primary spawning area may include a significant portion of the biomass; this project focused on expanding survey areas to quantify the biomass of fish spawning outside of the primary spawning location. Surveys were conducted during the spring of each year (late March to early April period) during 2012-2021. This effort is a continuation of similar adult herring acoustic surveys conducted within Prince William Sound from 2007 to 2012. Location of surveys were based in part on historical information and evidence garnered from aerial surveys of the distribution of dominant predators (particularly whales, seabirds, orcas and sea lions). Surveys were conducted using a 70 kHz single-beam hydroacoustic unit towed beside a vessel in a zig-zag survey design. During the surveys, the returned sound intensity from the sonar were recorded and stored for later processing and estimation of adult herring biomass in metric tons. The expanded survey effort was primarily focused on the spawning areas along Montague Island, where there have been consistent small spawning events since the mid-2000s. The main location of spawning has been in Port Gravina and Fidalgo bays in Prince William Sound.

All marine bird observations were conducted using established U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) protocols (USFWS 2007). Except for the March 2007 survey, all surveys record number of birds sighted by observers within a strip transect width of 300 m (150 m both sides and ahead of the boat, in 3 distance bins of 50 m) made by a research vessel. In March 2007, the strip-width was 200 m. The observer recorded observations into a laptop computer integrated with a global positioning system (GPS) using the program Dlog. The GPS-integrated program provided location data at 15-sec intervals and for every entered observation. Because surveys were conducted in conjunction with different research programs, observations were typically conducted under one of two scenarios: while boats were transiting between areas or, in the case of juvenile herring surveys, observations were conducted in juvenile herring survey bays along a zigzag track, approximately 200 m or greater from shore that coincides with the same transect line as the nocturnal hydroacoustic juvenile herring surveys. In the later years, the project expanded from placing bird observers on-board EVOS-sponsored PWS Science Center juvenile herring surveys and NOAA Humpback Whale surveys to include two additional ships of opportunity as observation platforms.

This dataset contains two types of comma-separated values (csv) files: CPR category files, describing abundances of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa retained by a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) during 2012 to 2016; and temperature files, which are water temperature measurement from a logger attached to the CPR. Data files are organized by year from 2011 to 2016. There are no 2011 plankton data in this collection but CPR data have been collected since 1997. Refer to Related Resource for cross reference to the longer timeseries plankton dataset. These data were collected to describe the plankton populations of the North Pacific and to monitor their distribution and abundance over multiple years. The CPR collected plankton samples as it was towed behind a merchant ship on a transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK, from 2012 to 2016, and water temperature data from a logger attached to the CPR. The CPR has sampled this transect monthly from spring through summer since 2004. There are also data from 2000-2003 from a previous transect. The current transect intersects with the outer part of the Seward Line and provides complementary large scale data to compare with the more local, finer scale plankton sampling on the shelf and in Prince William Sound (PWS). As part of the larger continuous dataset, several transects were occupied during 1997, and from 2000-2016. The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km).

Since 1993, the council has monitored samples from mussels and sediments at 10 sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. The samples are monitored for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons. Samples are collected in summer and late winter and results are presented in an annual report. This information provides a benchmark for assessing the ongoing impacts of routine tanker and terminal operations. The program has sampled twice a year since 1994 for evidence of hydrocarbons in mussel tissue and sediment samples. In recent years, the program was cut back to just mussel tissue at all sites with subtidal sediments only in Port Valdez (site of Alyeska Marine Terminal's tanker operations). For more complete sampling in Port Valdez, mussels are also collected in October. All samples are analyzed for PAH and AHC; sediments are also analzyed for TOC and sediment grain size. Results from PWSRCAC's studies indicate a variety of sources of hydrocarbons in Prince William Sound including the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, operations at the Alyeska terminal, combustion sources, boating and shipping activities, normal oil seepage or coal deposits, biological processes, and atmospheric fallout. Generally, the hydrocarbon levels detected under LTEMP have been relatively low. The stations farthest from the Alyeska terminal show low hydrocarbon levels, while those closest to the terminal show higher levels. Concern over the hydrocarbon levels at the terminal prompted PWSRCAC to add an additional sampling effort at the two Port Valdez stations in the fall of each year.

Gulf Watch Alaska is the long-term ecosystem monitoring program of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council for the marine ecosystem affected by the 1989 oil spill. This dataset contains two types of comma-separated values (csv) files: CPR category files, describing abundances of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa retained by a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR); and temperature data files, which are water temperature measurements from a logger attached to the CPR. Data files are organized by year from 2011 to 2020. There are no 2011 plankton data in this collection but CPR data have been collected since 1997. Refer to Related Resource for cross reference to the longer timeseries plankton dataset. These data were collected to describe the plankton populations of the North Pacific and to monitor their distribution and abundance over multiple years. The CPR collected plankton samples as it was towed behind a merchant ship on a transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK and water temperature data from a Brancker CTD-F attached to CPR. The CPR has sampled this transect monthly from spring through summer since 2004. There are also data from 2000-2003 from a previous transect. The current transect intersects with the outer part of the Seward Line and provides complementary large scale data to compare with the more local, finer scale plankton sampling on the shelf and in Prince William Sound (PWS). As part of the larger continuous dataset, several transects were occupied during 1997, and from 2000-2016. The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km). The entire transect is included from Juan de Fuca strait north to Cook Inlet.","Continuous Plankton Recorder and Temperature Data, Gulf of Alaska, 2012-2020, Gulf Watch Alaska Environmental Drivers Component","Sonia Batten"
