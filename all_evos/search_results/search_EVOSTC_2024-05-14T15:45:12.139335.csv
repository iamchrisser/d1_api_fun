Fish/Shellfish Study Number 11 was initiated as a State/Federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment project as part of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill study plan and continued through the 1992 work plan. Most components  of this report were published in October 1996 in the Canadian Journal ofFisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 53(10), followed by one article published in August 1997  in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 54(8).

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

Aerial surveys typically lack precision and are not sufficiently accurate to provide a standalone estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995). Varia estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995).  Variability due to sighting conditions, changes in vertical distribution of fish schools, and surveyor bias largely go unmeasured (Hunter and Chumside, 1995). It is therefore important to standardizea s manys urveyp arameters,s ucha s aircraft speed, altitude, time of day, etc., that can affect aeriale stimates(Caughleye t al., 1976).Thus, the main purpose of this study was to develop methodology and improve the precision of visual aerial survey estimates of surface schooling forage fish distribution and abundance. The specific objectives were to: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating estimation of detection error and surveyor bias and defining optimal survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination from visual aerial observations, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed to use the results in ecological analyses.  A secondary objective was to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations (Aequorea sp.) and foraging sea birds. This study demonstrates that aerial surveys are a useful tool for ecological research of forage fish, sea birds, and other marine species. In addition, surveyors can discriminate forage fish species and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. The methods described in this report outline an efficient, cost effective
way to obtain information on the distribution and abundance of forage fish and their predators. In addition, we have identified a model and the sources of error affecting the accuracy and precision of survey results. (from EVOSTC project #320-T final report)

***This work is part of a multi-reseracher, multi-project study of forage fish ecology and surving. The data here include tucker trawl larval surveys. Other data for this project can be referenced in the following packages: df35d.93.12 (http://evos.nceas.ucsb.edu/evos/metacat/df35d.93.12/default).

The hypothesis that juvenile herring aggregated within bays was tested by examining the relationship between the spatial distributions of herring and distances from shore. A group of data cells was considered to be a fish school if the sum of the differences between latitudes and longitudes of adjacent cells was >0.009'. Visual examination of the echograms and plots of cells along transects supported this assumption. Bays were statistically defined from passages or open coast line by creating a parameter that is the
sum of the three nearest shore distances (sum3NSD), each separated by 90"". This measurement was calculated at 12 bays and along 2 passages, 26 inside bays and 17 outside bays, to verify that it accurately defined bays, passages, and open coast line. The sum3NSD for each herrin g school within each size mode was calculated and compared to the same measurements from randomly selected points along the transect for the three surveys usinga chi-squared test. Expected values were grouped according to Cochran's rule (Sokal & Rohlf 198 1). This technique corrected sampling and shoreline structure biases, for example 80 % of the shoreline may have been in bays or we may have surveyed bays more than open coastline or passages. Further to determine if there were physical differences in water mass and larval fish community structure at these locations vertical water profiles measuring temperature and salinity at 1 m intervals, using a SeaBird instrument, and two tucker trawl samples (1 m^2 mouth, 505 micronmeter mesh nets) were collected at each of these sites. Tucker trawl samples were preserved in 10% formalin for >48 h, then transferred to 50% isopropyl alcohol and sorted to species and measured in the laboratory.","Juvenile Herring Growth and Habitats - [UNFORMATTED]","Brenda Norcross"

The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

EVOSTC project 090822 was originally a one year pilot project (070822) that began in spring 2007 and was extended for the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years. Work performed in 2008 is associated with EVOSTC project number 080822. Steve Moffitt, Alaska Department of Fish & Game Division of Commercial Fisheries, was the PI for the project during 2007 and 2008. In 2009 the PI responsibility was transferred to Rob Bochenek of Axiom Consulting & Design. This project suffered a serious impediment during 2008 when Jim Vansant, lead ADF&G data salvage technician, was killed in a construction accident.

Work performed in 2008 is associated with EVOSTC project number 080822. Steve Moffitt, Alaska Department of Fish & Game Division of Commercial Fisheries, was the PI for the project during 2007 and 2008. In 2009 the PI responsibility was transferred to Rob Bochenek of Axiom Consulting & Design. This project suffered a serious impediment during 2008 when Jim Vansant, lead ADF&G data salvage technician, was killed in a construction accident.

Agencies that collected the data include NOAA's Office of Coast Survey (OCS), NOAA's National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Marine Science (UAF IMS), Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC), and more.

These data sets were assembled in order to provide historical context for the current proposed project, ""Long-term monitoring of oceanographic conditions in Prince William Sound"" (EVOSTC Project 12120114-E). This project is a component of the integrated Long-term Monitoring of Marine Conditions and Injured Resources and Services submitted by McCammon et. al. This project is intended to provide physical and biological measurements that may be used to assess bottom-up impacts on the marine ecosystems of Prince William Sound. Specifically, it is proposed to deploy an autonomous profiling mooring in central Prince William Sound that will provide high frequency (~daily) depth-specific measurements of physical (temperature, salinity, turbidity), biogeochemical (nitrate, phosphate and silicate) and biological (Chlorophyll-a concentration) parameters that will be telemetered out in near real-time. Several regular vessel surveys are also proposed to provide ground-truth data for the mooring, and to attempt to capture some of the spatial variability in PWS. As well as the mooring site, the surveys will visit all four of the SEA bays to maintain ongoing EVOSTC funded time series measurements at those sites and to support proposed herring research (Pegau et. al). The major entrances (Hinchinbrook Entrance and Montague Strait) will also be visited. The surveys will make the same suite of measurements as the mooring, and will also collect water and plankton samples. This project will also link significantly with the herring research efforts proposed by Pegau et al., and will analyze plankton samples collected during intensive studies of juvenile herring feeding and energetics.","Long-term monitoring of oceanographic conditions in Prince William Sound, Alaska: 1973-2009","Rob Campbell"

Most components  of this report were published in October 1996 in the Canadian Journal ofFisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 53(10), followed by one article published in August 1997  in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 54(8). Permission to reproduce these articles was  granted  by the publisher, National Research Council of Canada, Research Press.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

The Restoration Plan identifies four services as lost or reduced by the oil spill -- subsistence, commercial fishing, recreation/tourism, and passive use. In preparation for the 10 Years After symposium, the recovery status of each of these services will be updated. Most of the work will take place in FY 99. However, providing startup costs for the subsistence component in FY 98 will allow a planning workshop to be held, the survey instrument to be finalized, and community approvals for the survey to be obtained this summer. This schedule will allow the survey itself to begin in October 1998. A final report will be prepared in February 1999; results will also be presented at the 10 Years After symposium in March 1999. [NOTE: This project was approved by the Trustee Council June 8, 1998. In the court request, these funds are shown as an addition to 98052A rather than as the separate project 98471].

From the Restoration Project Final Report produced in 2004:
The project updated information about subsistence harvests in 15 communities in order to evaluate the status of this injured natural resource service. In total, 544 households were interviewed. Subsistence harvests in 2003 averaged about 350 pounds per person and included a diverse range of species. Most households used, harvested, and shared wild foods. While overall community harvests approximated pre-spill estimates, about half the households reported lower total subsistence uses than before the spill and 39 percent blamed spill effects for continuing lower uses of at least one resource. Many respondents reported increased effort to harvest resources due to scarcities and competition. Confidence in eating clams is very low or eroding in eight study communities due to concerns about paralytic shellfish poisoning and spill effects. There were ambiguous findings regarding the role of elders and whether youth are learning subsistence skills. Respondents were often uncertain about the link between changes in their communities and the oil spill. Overall, 72 percent of respondents said that the traditional way of life has not recovered from the spill. The spill is an example of a technological disaster that is prolonged, difficult to interpret, and changes both the natural and social environments.

Notes from David Koster in June 2013:
While the raw data is protected as confidential under AS16.05.815, publicly available data on subsistence use can be found on the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Community Subsistence Information System (CSIS) at http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sb/CSIS/.

Subsistence harvests in 2003 averaged about 350 pounds per person and included a diverse range of species. Most households used, harvested, and shared wild foods. While overall community harvests approximated pre-spill estimates, about half the households reported lower total subsistence uses than before the spill and 39 percent blamed spill effects for continuing lower uses of at least one resource. Many respondents reported increased effort to harvest resources due to scarcities and competition. Confidence in eating clams is very low or eroding in eight study communities due to concerns about paralytic shellfish poisoning and spill effects. There were ambiguous findings regarding the role of elders and whether youth are learning subsistence skills. Respondents were often uncertain about the link between changes in their communities and the oil spill. Overall, 72 percent of respondents said that the traditional way of life has not recovered from the spill. The spill is an example of a technological disaster that is prolonged, difficult to interpret, and changes both the natural and social environments.

Notes from David Koster in June 2013:
While the raw data is protected as confidential under AS16.05.815, publicly available data on subsistence use can be found on the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Community Subsistence Information System (CSIS) at http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/sb/CSIS/. Specific data requests from the EVOSTC-funded project can be placed with David Koster on a case-by-case basis. Data agreements would require that the data be reported  only in aggregate format, the division have the opportunity to participate, and the data must be returned to the division upon completion of the specific research project covered under the agreement. Some aggregated data could also be gleaned from the final report.","Subsistence harvests and uses in Exxon Valdez oil spill area communities: 1998-1999, 2004","James Fall"

The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

Aerial surveys typically lack precision and are not sufficiently accurate to provide a standalone estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995). Varia estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995).  Variability due to sighting conditions, changes in vertical distribution of fish schools, and surveyor bias largely go unmeasured (Hunter and Chumside, 1995). It is therefore important to standardizea s manys urveyp arameters,s ucha s aircraft speed, altitude, time of day, etc., that can affect aeriale stimates(Caughleye t al., 1976).Thus, the main purpose of this study was to develop methodology and improve the precision of visual aerial survey estimates of surface schooling forage fish distribution and abundance. The specific objectives were to: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating estimation of detection error and surveyor bias and defining optimal survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination from visual aerial observations, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed to use the results in ecological analyses.  A secondary objective was to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations (Aequorea sp.) and foraging sea birds. This study demonstrates that aerial surveys are a useful tool for ecological research of forage fish, sea birds, and other marine species. In addition, surveyors can discriminate forage fish species and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. The methods described in this report outline an efficient, cost effective
way to obtain information on the distribution and abundance of forage fish and their predators. In addition, we have identified a model and the sources of error affecting the accuracy and precision of survey results. (from EVOSTC project #320-T final report)

***This work is part of a multi-reseracher, multi-project study of forage fish ecology and surving. The data here include tucker trawl larval surveys. Other data for this project can be referenced in the following packages: df35d.93.12 (http://evos.nceas.ucsb.edu/evos/metacat/df35d.93.12/default).

The hypothesis that juvenile herring aggregated within bays was tested by examining the relationship between the spatial distributions of herring and distances from shore. A group of data cells was considered to be a fish school if the sum of the differences between latitudes and longitudes of adjacent cells was >0.009'. Visual examination of the echograms and plots of cells along transects supported this assumption. Bays were statistically defined from passages or open coast line by creating a parameter that is the
sum of the three nearest shore distances (sum3NSD), each separated by 90"". This measurement was calculated at 12 bays and along 2 passages, 26 inside bays and 17 outside bays, to verify that it accurately defined bays, passages, and open coast line. The sum3NSD for each herrin g school within each size mode was calculated and compared to the same measurements from randomly selected points along the transect for the three surveys usinga chi-squared test. Expected values were grouped according to Cochran's rule (Sokal & Rohlf 198 1). This technique corrected sampling and shoreline structure biases, for example 80 % of the shoreline may have been in bays or we may have surveyed bays more than open coastline or passages. Further to determine if there were physical differences in water mass and larval fish community structure at these locations vertical water profiles measuring temperature and salinity at 1 m intervals, using a SeaBird instrument, and two tucker trawl samples (1 m^2 mouth, 505 micronmeter mesh nets) were collected at each of these sites. Tucker trawl samples were preserved in 10% formalin for >48 h, then transferred to 50% isopropyl alcohol and sorted to species and measured in the laboratory.","Juvenile Herring Growth and Habitats - [UNFORMATTED]","Brenda Norcorss"

Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected.

"46","df35a.22.7","urn:node:GOA","This project has developed a web-based data portal and consolidated, documented, and entered data sets, metadata, and other electronic resources into that web portal. The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

EVOSTC project 090822 was originally a one year pilot project (070822) that began in spring 2007 and was extended for the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years. Work performed in 2008 is associated with EVOSTC project number 080822. Steve Moffitt, Alaska Department of Fish & Game Division of Commercial Fisheries, was the PI for the project during 2007 and 2008. In 2009 the PI responsibility was transferred to Rob Bochenek of Axiom Consulting & Design. This project suffered a serious impediment during 2008 when Jim Vansant, lead ADF&G data salvage technician, was killed in a construction accident.

"50","df35b.3.8","urn:node:GOA","This project is a component of the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program, a multi-disciplinary effort to acquire an ecosystem level understanding of the marine and freshwater processes that interact to constrain levels of fish, marine bird, and marine mammal production in Prince William Sound (PWS). Research conducted under the Sound Ecosystem Assessment project (SEA, /320) has shown that Pacific herring have significant dependence on Gulf of Alaska carbon. Accordingly, herring are subject to changes in carbon flow occurring between the Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound. The first step in understanding how this fundamental environmental process affects herring recruitment is to isotopically analyze a time series of herring for which energetic data have been collected. This will expand upon the data series available from SEA, providing a total four-year time period corresponding to one period in the cyclicity of herring population abundance in Prince William Sound.

Gulf Watch Alaska is the long-term ecosystem monitoring program of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council for the marine ecosystem affected by the 1989 oil spill. This dataset contains two types of comma-separated values (csv) files: CPR category files, describing abundances of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa retained by a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) during 2012 to 2016; and temperature files, which are water temperature measurement from a logger attached to the CPR. Data files are organized by year from 2011 to 2016. There are no 2011 plankton data in this collection but CPR data have been collected since 1997. Refer to Related Resource for cross reference to the longer timeseries plankton dataset. These data were collected to describe the plankton populations of the North Pacific and to monitor their distribution and abundance over multiple years. The CPR collected plankton samples as it was towed behind a merchant ship on a transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK, from 2012 to 2016, and water temperature data from a logger attached to the CPR. The CPR has sampled this transect monthly from spring through summer since 2004. There are also data from 2000-2003 from a previous transect. The current transect intersects with the outer part of the Seward Line and provides complementary large scale data to compare with the more local, finer scale plankton sampling on the shelf and in Prince William Sound (PWS). As part of the larger continuous dataset, several transects were occupied during 1997, and from 2000-2016. The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km). The entire transect is included from Juan de Fuca strait north to Cook Inlet.","Continuous Plankton Recorder and Temperature Data, Gulf of Alaska, 2011-2016, Gulf Watch Alaska Environmental Drivers Component","Sonia Batten"

The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km). The entire transect is included from Juan de Fuca strait north to Cook Inlet.","Continuous Plankton Recorder and Temperature Data, Gulf of Alaska, 2011-2016, Gulf Watch Alaska Environmental Drivers Component","Sonia Batten"

Surveying from the air has the benefit of covering a large geographic area while minimizing the disturbance of herring. Aerial surveys cover waters that are too shallow for acoustic survey vessels to access. Aerial surveys were conducted from 2010 to 2012 during the months of June, July, and August as part of the PWS Herring Survey program by Evelyn Brown (EVOSTC project number 10100132-F).

Fisheries managers use population models to determine the level of commercial fishing to allow annually. These models are based on the number of fish observed during the spawning period. However, this method fails to count a portion of the younger fish, because they do not participate in the spawn. This project, conducted from 2012 to 2015, aimed to improve the estimate of the total herring population by examining the percent of fish of various ages that join the herring stock after the spawning period. Using a captive population of wild adult herring, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Juneau, Alaska conducted a lab study to assess the feasibility of identifying whether individual herring were immature (have never spawned), primiparous (have spawned only once), or repeat spawners. Researchers tested whether the age at first spawn could be determined by analyzing the history of egg development in the ovaries (histology), or by using growth increments on herring scales (which is a less expensive method).

Past research of juvenile Pacific herring in PWS has shown that recruitment is highly influenced by conditions within nursery sites affecting survival within the first year. Important among these factors is the pre-winter condition of juvenile (age-0) herring and the effects of water temperatures on their metabolism. Studies of the physical oceanography of nursery fjords during the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program indicate that each site has a unique set of hydrographic conditions that are influenced by both local processes and water exchange between the Gulf of Alaska and PWS. These factors vary significantly depending on geographic location, basin morphometry, watershed topography and proximity to sources of glacial water. This dataset includes the following: 1) temperature and salinity data collected by moored and profiled CTDs; and 2) thermistors strung at specific depth intervals on the moorings. The data were collected from 2010 to 2012, and built upon a 2007-2008 study funded by the EVOSTC (entitled Physical Oceanographic Factors Affecting Productivity in Juvenile Pacific Herring Nursery Habitats, EVOS project numbers: 070817, 080817, 090817) by continuing a hydrographic time series within the four principal PWS nursery fjords: Simpson Bay, Eaglek Bay, Whale Bay, and Zaikof Bay.

In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations.

As part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132), from March 2010 through March 2012 castnets and gillnets were deployed in bays of Prince William Sound to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March. In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations. A list of these projects and the associated EVOS project numbers is provided in Supplemental Information.","Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring, 2010-2016: EVOS Herring Program","Mary Anne Bishop"

Surveying from the air has the benefit of covering a large geographic area while minimizing the disturbance of herring. Aerial surveys cover waters that are too shallow for acoustic survey vessels to access. Aerial surveys were conducted from 2010 to 2012 during the months of June, July, and August as part of the PWS Herring Survey program by Evelyn Brown (EVOSTC project number 10100132-F). Beginning in 2013 (under EVOSTC projects 12120111-O, 14120111-R, and 16120111-O) surveys have been conducted in June focused on age-1 herring and in July in support of the project entitled Forage Fish Distribution, Abundance, and Body Condition in Prince William Sound, 2012-2015: Gulf Watch Alaska Pelagic Component (EVOSTC projects 12120114-O, 14120114-O, and 16120114-O).

Past research of juvenile Pacific herring in PWS has shown that recruitment is highly influenced by conditions within nursery sites affecting survival within the first year. Important among these factors is the pre-winter condition of juvenile (age-0) herring and the effects of water temperatures on their metabolism. Studies of the physical oceanography of nursery fjords during the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program indicate that each site has a unique set of hydrographic conditions that are influenced by both local processes and water exchange between the Gulf of Alaska and PWS. These factors vary significantly depending on geographic location, basin morphometry, watershed topography and proximity to sources of glacial water. This dataset includes the following: 1) temperature and salinity data collected by moored and profiled CTDs; and 2) thermistors strung at specific depth intervals on the moorings. The data were collected from 2010 to 2012, and built upon a 2007-2008 study funded by the EVOSTC (entitled Physical Oceanographic Factors Affecting Productivity in Juvenile Pacific Herring Nursery Habitats, EVOS project numbers: 070817, 080817, 090817) by continuing a hydrographic time series within the four principal PWS nursery fjords: Simpson Bay, Eaglek Bay, Whale Bay, and Zaikof Bay.

Fisheries managers use population models to determine the level of commercial fishing to allow annually. These models are based on the number of fish observed during the spawning period. However, this method fails to count a portion of the younger fish, because they do not participate in the spawn. This project, conducted from 2012 to 2015, aimed to improve the estimate of the total herring population by examining the percent of fish of various ages that join the herring stock after the spawning period. Using a captive population of wild adult herring, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Juneau, Alaska conducted a lab study to assess the feasibility of identifying whether individual herring were immature (have never spawned), primiparous (have spawned only once), or repeat spawners. Researchers tested whether the age at first spawn could be determined by analyzing the history of egg development in the ovaries (histology), or by using growth increments on herring scales (which is a less expensive method).

The CPR collected plankton samples as it was towed behind a merchant ship on a transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK, from 2012 to 2016, and water temperature data from a logger attached to the CPR. The CPR has sampled this transect monthly from spring through summer since 2004. There are also data from 2000-2003 from a previous transect. The current transect intersects with the outer part of the Seward Line and provides complementary large scale data to compare with the more local, finer scale plankton sampling on the shelf and in Prince William Sound (PWS). As part of the larger continuous dataset, several transects were occupied during 1997, and from 2000-2016. The samples each represent 18.5km of tow and have been processed according to routine CPR protocols as directed by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) which operates and maintains the CPR survey. The midpoint of each sample is allocated a position and time based on information on deployment and recovery times from the ship's log. Vemco temperature loggers were attached to the CPR and used to record temperature of the water that the plankton are living in. The logger is affixed to the CPR, towed in the wake of the ship, at the depth of the CPR, on each transect from Tacoma, WA to Anchorage, AK. Loggers are nominally at 6 m depth, but within well mixed surface water behind the ship. The logger records the temperature every 5 minutes. After sampling, each temperature record is given a position that is interpolated from ship's log data, according to the date/time stamp of the record. Positions may be off by some amount (likely less than 1km). The entire transect is included from Juan de Fuca strait north to Cook Inlet.","Continuous Plankton Recorder and Temperature Data, Gulf of Alaska, 2011-2016, Gulf Watch Alaska Environmental Drivers Component","Sonia Batten"

There are two csv files and one R file. The csv files contain data on (1) fish fork length, mass, survival and infection status of the fish (using a culture method) (Master data), and (2) results from an image analysis conducted on histological preps of ventricle tissue of herring infected with Ichthyophonus. Data include the area of tissue with host response, parasite stages and the total area of the ventricle. The 18-2 code includes an analysis of these data. Additional data and code collected are in reference to fish health surveys of wild herring conducted in late March and early April (e.g., around spawning) in Sitka Sound and Prince William Sound. Fish health data were collected in conjunction with the EVOSTC Herring Research and Monitoring Program disease program. The csv file, 'AK samples for R', includes the date, location, age, length, sex and infection status (IchFinal), for the fish sampled.
