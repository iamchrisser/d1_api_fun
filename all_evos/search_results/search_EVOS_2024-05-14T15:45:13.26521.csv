"1","df35i.24.34","urn:node:GOA","We surveyed murres (Uria spp.) annually from 1989 through 1991 at breeding
colonies within the trajectory of the oil to determine whether numbers had declined and to
evaluate the effects of oil on nesting phenology and reproductive success, following the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The colonies we surveyed contained the majority of the estimated
200,000 murres attending colonies in the affected area, and we found reduced numbers at all
study colonies following the spill. In addition, nesting was delayed and productivity rates
were far below normal following the spill. In contrast, numbers of murres did not decline and
reproductive parameters were normal at 2 colonies we surveyed outside the trajectory.
The only indication of recovery since the spill was a slight increase in reproductive success at
monitored colonies in 1991. The most likely cause of reduced numbers of murres at cliffs
following the oil spill was direct mortality from the oil. Since breeding murres were
congregating near colonies at the time of the spill, most murres killed were probably
experienced breeders. We concluded that reduced densities and skewed age structures were
the most likely causes of abnormal breeding after the spill.","Effects of EVOS on abundances and reproduction of Murre colonies, near PWS, coastal Kenai and Alaska Peninsulas, and Kodiak Island (1989-1991).","David Nysewander"

Study History:  
Fish/Shellfish Study Number 11 was initiated as a State/Federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment project as part of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill study plan and continued through the 1992 work plan. Most components  of this report were published in October 1996 in the Canadian Journal ofFisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 53(10), followed by one article published in August 1997  in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, vol. 54(8). Permission to reproduce these articles was  granted  by the publisher, National Research Council of Canada, Research Press.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

Varia estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995).

It is therefore important to standardizea s manys urveyp arameters,s ucha s aircraft speed, altitude, time of day, etc., that can affect aeriale stimates(Caughleye t al., 1976).Thus, the main purpose of this study was to develop methodology and improve the precision of visual aerial survey estimates of surface schooling forage fish distribution and abundance. The specific objectives were to: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating estimation of detection error and surveyor bias and defining optimal survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination from visual aerial observations, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed to use the results in ecological analyses.  A secondary objective was to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations (Aequorea sp.) and foraging sea birds. This study demonstrates that aerial surveys are a useful tool for ecological research of forage fish, sea birds, and other marine species. In addition, surveyors can discriminate forage fish species and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. The methods described in this report outline an efficient, cost effective
way to obtain information on the distribution and abundance of forage fish and their predators. In addition, we have identified a model and the sources of error affecting the accuracy and precision of survey results. (from EVOSTC project #320-T final report)

The hypothesis that juvenile herring aggregated within bays was tested by examining the relationship between the spatial distributions of herring and distances from shore. A group of data cells was considered to be a fish school if the sum of the differences between latitudes and longitudes of adjacent cells was >0.009'. Visual examination of the echograms and plots of cells along transects supported this assumption. Bays were statistically defined from passages or open coast line by creating a parameter that is the
sum of the three nearest shore distances (sum3NSD), each separated by 90"". This measurement was calculated at 12 bays and along 2 passages, 26 inside bays and 17 outside bays, to verify that it accurately defined bays, passages, and open coast line. The sum3NSD for each herrin g school within each size mode was calculated and compared to the same measurements from randomly selected points along the transect for the three surveys usinga chi-squared test. Expected values were grouped according to Cochran's rule (Sokal & Rohlf 198 1). This technique corrected sampling and shoreline structure biases, for example 80 % of the shoreline may have been in bays or we may have surveyed bays more than open coastline or passages. Further to determine if there were physical differences in water mass and larval fish community structure at these locations vertical water profiles measuring temperature and salinity at 1 m intervals, using a SeaBird instrument, and two tucker trawl samples (1 m^2 mouth, 505 micronmeter mesh nets) were collected at each of these sites.

"15","df35a.22.5","urn:node:GOA","This project has developed a web-based data portal and consolidated, documented, and entered data sets, metadata, and other electronic resources into that web portal. The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

Attribute data (location, taxa, metrics, methods...) for each reference are accessible through the ArcView tables and the Excel spreadsheet. All references included in the metadata base, plus references such as review articles without geo-spatial reference can also be accessed through a Procite database. The metadata set and the ArcView themes will aid the EVOS Trustee Council members with their decision-making regarding the long-term monitoring and restoration plans for nearshore environments in the Gulf of Alaska.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

colonies within the trajectory of the oil to determine whether numbers had declined and to
evaluate the effects of oil on nesting phenology and reproductive success, following the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The colonies we surveyed contained the majority of the estimated
200,000 murres attending colonies in the affected area, and we found reduced numbers at all
study colonies following the spill. In addition, nesting was delayed and productivity rates
were far below normal following the spill. In contrast, numbers of murres did not decline and
reproductive parameters were normal at 2 colonies we surveyed outside the trajectory.
The only indication of recovery since the spill was a slight increase in reproductive success at
monitored colonies in 1991. The most likely cause of reduced numbers of murres at cliffs
following the oil spill was direct mortality from the oil. Since breeding murres were
congregating near colonies at the time of the spill, most murres killed were probably
experienced breeders. We concluded that reduced densities and skewed age structures were
the most likely causes of abnormal breeding after the spill.","Effects of EVOS on abundances and reproduction of Murre colonies, near PWS, coastal Kenai and Alaska Peninsulas, and Kodiak Island (1989-1991).","David Nysewander"

"52","df35i.17.6","urn:node:GOA","Subsistence users from the remote Alaska Peninsula Native Village of Perryville had noted significant declines in the coho salmon run in the nearby Kametolook River since the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS). The Trustee Council began funding a project in Federal Fiscal Year 1997 (October 1, 1996 - September 30, 1997) with the intent of restoring this coho salmon run. This project was a continuation of an evaluative phase of the project funded through the EVOS criminal settlement (Grant Agreement Number 21685881 May through September 1996). The criminal settlement funded the project for an assessment team from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) and local assistants from the Native Village of Perryville. The assessment period determined the preferred method to restore the Kametolook River's coho salmon run to historic levels. This phase ended with the approval of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in May 1997. The EA and project review supported instream incubation boxes as the preferred restoration alternative.

Annually, every November 1997 through 2001, coho salmon eggs were placed in two Kametolook River instream incubation boxes to improve the green egg to fry survival over natural in-river conditions. Since, 1997, the Kametolook River coho escapement has shown some improvement. The later coho salmon escapement level can also be partially attributed to self-imposed in-river harvest restrictions by the villagers and commercial fishing restrictions in marine waters. Community involvement and use of local traditional ecological knowledge by the villagers of Perryville was also an integral part of the projects plan toward the restoration of Kametolook River coho salmon as a subsistence resource. Kametolook River coho escapement estimates didn't increase significantly over the six years of the project as hoped. This is due in part to the low number of annual returning adult coho salmon available for the egg takes and natural spawning.

In 1999, The Perryville Subsistence Workgroup was formed to address the subsistence needs of Perryville residents and has remained active throughout the remainder of this project. This group is currently seeking funding that will allow the egg box project to continue beyond September 2002. In addition, this group also hopes to obtain genetic and pathology samples of nearby coho systems (fish transport permit requirements) and the eventual transport of eggs from these systems to the Kametolook River egg boxes. This additional work should increase escapements in the Kametolook River and thus provide more eggs for the incubation boxes and eventually a surplus of adult coho salmon available for Perryville residents' subsistence fishing.

Also as part of the project, starting in 1996 a school aquarium project for the Perryville School was set up and maintained annually throughout all project years. Annually approximately 300 to 500 fertilized coho salmon eggs were placed in the Perryville school aquarium and students followed the development of the eggs to the swim up fry stage. The teachers developed lesson plans in biology and ecology around the aquarium project and developed a stewardship of the local salmon runs with the students.","Kametolook River Coho Salmon Subsistence Project, Perryville, Alaska (1997 - 2002).","Lisa Hutchinson-Scarbrough"

A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Subsequently, annual reports were submitted entitled Habitat Use, Behavior, and Monitoring of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound: 1994 Annual Report, 1995 Annual Report, 1996 Annual Report , 1997 Annual Report, 1998 Annual Report, and 1999 Annual Report . Fatty acid studies funded under Restoration Project 94320-F (Trophic Interactions of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound) were included in the 1994 annual report for 94064. Fatty acid studies were continued and reported as part of this study for the duration of the project.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

We analyzed more than 5000 specimens of 14 forage species, and zooplankton and epibenthic prey samples from Prince William Sound (PWS), 1994-96. Forage fish were collected monthly in western PWS with purse seines in 1994 and in three regions of PWS (southwestern, central and northeastern) with a mid-water trawl in 1995 (summer and autumn) and with a beach seine in 1996 (summer). The species examined were mainly young-of-the-year (YOY) and age 1 walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific herring (Clupeu pallasi), Pacific sandlance (Ammodytes hexapterus), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum salmon (O. keta), sockeye salmon (O. nerka), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific tomcod (Microgadus proximus), prowfish (Zaprora silenus), northern smoothtongue (Leuroglossus schmidti), eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and Pacific sandfish (Trichodon trichodon). We compared seasonal size, diet composition and diet overlap between species from May-November, 1994; described the diets, prey fields and prey selection of juvenile pollock and herring in summer and autumn, 1995 and of juvenile herring, sandlance and pink salmon in summer, 1996; examined for prey shifts and feeding declines when the 1995-96 fish occurred in multi-species aggregations (sympatrically) compared to when they occurred in single species aggregations (allopatrically) to test for competition; and compared diet composition interannually for several species in July of the three years.

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

We employed an operating model approach, creating simulated harbor seal population dynamics and haulout behavior that incorporated all factors thought to potentially affect the performance of aerial surveys. We found that adjusting counts for the effects of covariates such as survey date or stage of tide was both possible and essential. Annual estimates of the average fraction of the population hauled out are also advised.

This project is primarily a re-analysis of existing empirical data collected by the ADF&G and NMFS during studies to assess the population trend and abundance of harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska, including Prince William Sound. These data are primarily counts of harbor seals obtained from both aerial surveys and land-based
monitoring studies. Additional data include the geographic location of the seal haulout where the counts were obtained, and records of environmental variables associated with the count data: e.g., date, time, tidal stage.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999.

Earlier studies stated that there are only a few streams in Prince William Sound with these species, but after consultation with local residents, it appeared these fish were more widespread than previously believed. Given these uncertainties, we consulted local residents, government agencies, Native groups, and other knowledgeable individuals to determine where these species could be found. Streams and lake systems were surveyed by field crews to determine the presence or absence of these species. We found 29 lakes and streams which had undocumented populations of these and other anadromous fish species. The number of undocumented populations by species were as follows: 23 Dolly Varden, 21 cutthroat trout, 14 coho salmon (O. kisutch), two sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and one chum salmon (O. keta). Six resident Dolly Varden and six resident cutthroat trout populations were also identified. The results of this study are being used to update the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, or Migration of Anadromous Fishes, (Anadromous Waters Catalog) and assist the research being conducted under EVOS project 96145.

The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this study was to estimate and compare egg larval mortality between oiled and nonoiled areas of the sound. Secondary objectives flowed from the requirements of estimating egg larval mortality and involved analyses of ancillary variables, such as depth profiles of temperature and salinity, width of egg beds and the depth distribution of eggs, mean length of larvae, rate of growth of larval length, and rate of reduction in larval density at plankton stations.

The North Gulf Oceanic Society (NGOS) independently maintained a monitoring program in all other years since 1984. The goal of the photo monitoring has been to obtain identification photographs of all whales in all major resident pods and the AT1 transient group on an annual basis. Photo-identification techniques (after Bigg, et. al. 1990) were used to identify individual whales. The current photographic database includes tens of thousands of frames of film collected from 1984-2011 and is used to provide individual identifications for each encounter with whales.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

Sample locations included Prince William Sound (4 sites) and Kodiak Island(1site)intheGulfof Alaska, and Togiak Bay (1 site) and Norton Sound (1 site) in the Bering Sea. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a marked genetic discontinuity between herring in the Bering Sea and Gulfof Alaska. The estimatesof genetic differentiation between populations from the two sea basins (F_BT) were significant (P<0.001) and ranged from 0.169 for mtDNA to 0.209 for microsatellites. The estimates of genetic differentiation within sea basins (F_SB) were 0.013 for mtDNA and 0.030f or microsatellites and were significant (P<0.001). The microsatellites also showed significant (P<0.001) temporal variation within the Gulf of Alaska. The estimates of genetic variation between years at each sample location(F_SL) were 0.011 formicrosatellites and 0.012 for mtDNA. The temporal shifts in genetic structure may reflect large inter-annual variation in reproductive success and hamper the use of genetic markers for discrete stock management of herring in Prince William Sound.

This multi-year study was initiated in FY94 as Restoration Project 94165. However, a return failure of herring in Prince William Sound in 1994 delayed implementation until FY95. During the first two years (FY95, FY96) new molecular markers were developed and tested for population genetic analyses. In addition, herring samples were collected from spawning aggregations within Prince William Sound (4 sites), Kodiak Island(1 site), TogiakBay (1 site), and Norton Sound(1 site). During the final two years (FY97, FY98) samples were genotyped and genetic data were analyzed. Preliminary results were reported to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS)Trustee Council and EVOS project reviewers in a poster session at the January1996 EVOS workshop in Anchorage. A synthesis of the herring genetic data was reported to the EVOS peer reviewers in February 1998. Four reports were submitted consulting scientists detailing the development and application of mtDNA and microsatellite markers. One progress report was submitted by the principal investigators in 1996 under the title Genetic Discrimination of Prince William Sound Herring Populations.

The efforts of this project have resulted in a considerable increase in available historic time series data regarding herring ecosystem dynamics in Prince William Sound. The web portal provides public access to information, data and GIS visualizations. Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here.

Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Aerial surveys typically lack precision and are not sufficiently accurate to provide a standalone estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995). Varia estimate of stock biomass (Krebs 1989; Gunderson 1993; Hunter and Chumside, 1995).  Variability due to sighting conditions, changes in vertical distribution of fish schools, and surveyor bias largely go unmeasured (Hunter and Chumside, 1995). It is therefore important to standardizea s manys urveyp arameters,s ucha s aircraft speed, altitude, time of day, etc., that can affect aeriale stimates(Caughleye t al., 1976).Thus, the main purpose of this study was to develop methodology and improve the precision of visual aerial survey estimates of surface schooling forage fish distribution and abundance. The specific objectives were to: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating estimation of detection error and surveyor bias and defining optimal survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination from visual aerial observations, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed to use the results in ecological analyses.  A secondary objective was to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations (Aequorea sp.) and foraging sea birds. This study demonstrates that aerial surveys are a useful tool for ecological research of forage fish, sea birds, and other marine species. In addition, surveyors can discriminate forage fish species and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. The methods described in this report outline an efficient, cost effective
way to obtain information on the distribution and abundance of forage fish and their predators. In addition, we have identified a model and the sources of error affecting the accuracy and precision of survey results. (from EVOSTC project #320-T final report)

***This work is part of a multi-reseracher, multi-project study of forage fish ecology and surving. The data here include tucker trawl larval surveys. Other data for this project can be referenced in the following packages: df35d.93.12 (http://evos.nceas.ucsb.edu/evos/metacat/df35d.93.12/default).

The hypothesis that juvenile herring aggregated within bays was tested by examining the relationship between the spatial distributions of herring and distances from shore. A group of data cells was considered to be a fish school if the sum of the differences between latitudes and longitudes of adjacent cells was >0.009'. Visual examination of the echograms and plots of cells along transects supported this assumption. Bays were statistically defined from passages or open coast line by creating a parameter that is the
sum of the three nearest shore distances (sum3NSD), each separated by 90"". This measurement was calculated at 12 bays and along 2 passages, 26 inside bays and 17 outside bays, to verify that it accurately defined bays, passages, and open coast line. The sum3NSD for each herrin g school within each size mode was calculated and compared to the same measurements from randomly selected points along the transect for the three surveys usinga chi-squared test. Expected values were grouped according to Cochran's rule (Sokal & Rohlf 198 1). This technique corrected sampling and shoreline structure biases, for example 80 % of the shoreline may have been in bays or we may have surveyed bays more than open coastline or passages. Further to determine if there were physical differences in water mass and larval fish community structure at these locations vertical water profiles measuring temperature and salinity at 1 m intervals, using a SeaBird instrument, and two tucker trawl samples (1 m^2 mouth, 505 micronmeter mesh nets) were collected at each of these sites. Tucker trawl samples were preserved in 10% formalin for >48 h, then transferred to 50% isopropyl alcohol and sorted to species and measured in the laboratory.","Juvenile Herring Growth and Habitats - [UNFORMATTED]","Brenda Norcorss"

A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill. Subsequently, annual reports were submitted entitled Habitat Use, Behavior, and Monitoring of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound: 1994 Annual Report, 1995 Annual Report, 1996 Annual Report , 1997 Annual Report, 1998 Annual Report, and 1999 Annual Report . Fatty acid studies funded under Restoration Project 94320-F (Trophic Interactions of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound) were included in the 1994 annual report for 94064. Fatty acid studies were continued and reported as part of this study for the duration of the project.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

Scientist and researchers can use the web portal as a resource to assist in consolidating, accessing and synthesizing herring data. This project has also developed an ArcPad application for collecting herring aerial survey data directly into a GIS format. Also produced by this project are a set of technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for efficiently ingesting, managing and serving ecological datasets in an open, scalable and standardized way. These SOPs were developed in the last phase of this effort and also document the technical architecture of system implementation. The project was conceived during an EVOS-sponsored workshop in April 2006 that was tasked to identify Prince William Sound herring data gaps and develop restoration or research projects to help herring recovery. Participants indicated that knowledge of the spatial and temporal aspects of herring related data sets (e.g., herring spawn) was necessary to understand how restoration activities might affect herring abundance trajectories. This project has improved data quality and provided easier access and visualization of selected herring data sets and other electronic resources.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Sample locations included Prince William Sound (4 sites) and Kodiak Island(1site)intheGulfof Alaska, and Togiak Bay (1 site) and Norton Sound (1 site) in the Bering Sea. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a marked genetic discontinuity between herring in the Bering Sea and Gulfof Alaska. The estimatesof genetic differentiation between populations from the two sea basins (F_BT) were significant (P<0.001) and ranged from 0.169 for mtDNA to 0.209 for microsatellites. The estimates of genetic differentiation within sea basins (F_SB) were 0.013 for mtDNA and 0.030f or microsatellites and were significant (P<0.001). The microsatellites also showed significant (P<0.001) temporal variation within the Gulf of Alaska. The estimates of genetic variation between years at each sample location(F_SL) were 0.011 formicrosatellites and 0.012 for mtDNA. The temporal shifts in genetic structure may reflect large inter-annual variation in reproductive success and hamper the use of genetic markers for discrete stock management of herring in Prince William Sound.

This multi-year study was initiated in FY94 as Restoration Project 94165. However, a return failure of herring in Prince William Sound in 1994 delayed implementation until FY95. During the first two years (FY95, FY96) new molecular markers were developed and tested for population genetic analyses. In addition, herring samples were collected from spawning aggregations within Prince William Sound (4 sites), Kodiak Island(1 site), TogiakBay (1 site), and Norton Sound(1 site). During the final two years (FY97, FY98) samples were genotyped and genetic data were analyzed. Preliminary results were reported to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS)Trustee Council and EVOS project reviewers in a poster session at the January1996 EVOS workshop in Anchorage. A synthesis of the herring genetic data was reported to the EVOS peer reviewers in February 1998. Four reports were submitted consulting scientists detailing the development and application of mtDNA and microsatellite markers. One progress report was submitted by the principal investigators in 1996 under the title Genetic Discrimination of Prince William Sound Herring Populations.

In total, 2,117,781 raw sequencing reads were generated with an average length of 254 bp. All data was submitted to NBCIÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Short Read Archive under accession number SRX022719.

By using trace element signatures of edge portions of juvenile herring otoliths, we identified the otolith chemical signature of individual rearing bays within Sitka Sound. We used trace element signatures of edge portions of adult herring otoliths to identify the otolith chemical signature of spawning areas within Sitka Sound. We also used trace element signatures of edge portions to compare to core portions of juvenile and adult herring to identify source and sink habitat in Sitka Sound. The results of the technique used in this project indicate that herring use different and distinct habitats in Sitka Sound during their life. Once we know which population contributes more to the spawning groups, we can then identify those variables that enhance the life histories of the source population. This will allow managers to protect the most important populations and also identify which variables can be altered to improve habitat f or other populations. These techniques used in Sitka Sound can be directly transferred to Prince W illiam Sound, leading to better identification
of essential fish habitat in Prince William Sound.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

Prince William Sound (PWS) is one of the largest areas of protected waters bordering the  Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  It, and the nearby open waters of the Gulf, provide foraging areas for populations of apex predators including piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals.  These surface- dependent predators were adversely impacted by the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill (EVOS); and many experienced declines from which they have not recovered. Piscivorous seabirds and marine mammals in PWS are near the apex of food webs based on pelagic production of small fishes, including Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus),  walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus); and macroinvertebrates, especially euphausiids, commonly called krill.  The lack of recovery by some seabirds may be due to long-term changes in forage species abundance.  In this report we describe abundance and distribution patterns of small pelagic fishes in Prince William Sound, based on acoustic surveys. 

The research described in thls report was part of a program (APEX) designed to determine if prey availability is limiting the recovery of seabird populations that were impacted by the EVOS.  The main tool for measuring the distribution and abundance of forage fishes is hydroacoustics. Hydroacoustics can measure horizontal and vertical abundance and biomass at scales not possible by traditional net sampling techniques, and has been used to quantify fish (Thorne et al. 1977, Thorne et  al. 1982, Mathisen et al. 1978) and the spatial patterns of a variety of aquatic populations (Gerlotto 1993; Baussant et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993).  Ln  Alaskan waters, acoustics have been used to measure biomass relative to tidally-generated frontal features (Coyle and Cooney 1993) and the relationship between murre foraging, tidal currents and water masses in the southeast Bering Sea (Coyle et al. 1992). Acoustic sampling cannot positively identify the species of targets; consequently,  net sampling must be conducted concurrently with acoustics to identify species and to provide size distribution data necessary for biomass estimations.

We analyzed more than 5000 specimens of 14 forage species, and zooplankton and epibenthic prey samples from Prince William Sound (PWS), 1994-96. Forage fish were collected monthly in western PWS with purse seines in 1994 and in three regions of PWS (southwestern, central and northeastern) with a mid-water trawl in 1995 (summer and autumn) and with a beach seine in 1996 (summer). The species examined were mainly young-of-the-year (YOY) and age 1 walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific herring (Clupeu pallasi), Pacific sandlance (Ammodytes hexapterus), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum salmon (O. keta), sockeye salmon (O. nerka), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific tomcod (Microgadus proximus), prowfish (Zaprora silenus), northern smoothtongue (Leuroglossus schmidti), eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and Pacific sandfish (Trichodon trichodon). We compared seasonal size, diet composition and diet overlap between species from May-November, 1994; described the diets, prey fields and prey selection of juvenile pollock and herring in summer and autumn, 1995 and of juvenile herring, sandlance and pink salmon in summer, 1996; examined for prey shifts and feeding declines when the 1995-96 fish occurred in multi-species aggregations (sympatrically) compared to when they occurred in single species aggregations (allopatrically) to test for competition; and compared diet composition interannually for several species in July of the three years.

A final report was issued in 1994 for the combined Marine Mammal Study Number 5 and Restoration Study Number 73, entitled Assessment of Injury to Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Adjacent Areas Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.

Abstract: We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs.

Restoration Project 040574 assessed the generality and persistence of this apparent injury to this assemblage. Sites were re-assessed in 2010 to test for long term effects of treatment. The major purposes of this study were to monitor recovery and compare bivalve abundance patterns to those observed in 2002.  As such, the 39 sites occupied during this study were specifically those sampled in the EVOS TC 2002 study (Lees and Driskell 2007).  GPS coordinates and site photographs from the 2002 study were used to reoccupy the same area to the degree allowable by tide levels at the time of sampling.  One site, Northwest Bay West Arm, was deleted from this suite of sites on the understanding that NOAA would sample it during a complementary study.  That site ultimately was not sampled.  The data here represent the bivalve survey results from these assessments. Note: This is an assessment of the bivalves, although various non-bivalve species are included in both data sets. These species were excluded from any of the analyses under this project but are available here for further analysis.  Additionally, although mussel Mytilus trossulus are included in both data sets, this species was also excluded from any of the analyses as it is an epifaunal organism that would only confuse analyses of the infaunal bivalves.

Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) aerial surveys, 1995 - 1997:
We show that aerial visual surveys are a cost-effective method to assess distribution and abundance of forage fish and seabirds and produce repeatable results with an acceptable level of error. We fulfilled our main objectives concerning forage fish assessment: 1) develop an appropriate survey design incorporating detection error, surveyor bias, and survey constraints, 2) determine the accuracy of fish species and age class discrimination, 3) determine the repeatability of aerial measurements, and 4) determine the spatial resolution of aerial measurements needed for ecological analyses. We also fulfilled our secondary objective to develop abundance estimates for jellyfish aggregations and seabirds. We developed an adaptive modified line transect methodology and model incorporating a detection curve for Pacific herring (Clupea pallusi), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hempems), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissu triductylu) and a detection correction factor for fish schools. We established survey condition constraints and an optimal survey altitude range of 274 - 366 m based on school size and sightability of seabirds. We developed logging software to obtain flight path and sighting coordinates and incorporated measurements of schools using a sighting tube. The altitude dependent flight swath or transect width for fish schools was estimated from the detection curve at 474 m at an altitude of 305 m. The detection correction factor was estimated at 0.727 resulting in an undercounting rate of approximately 37.5%. Using double counting, individual surveyor bias was estimated at 6.5% for school counts and 7.0% for school surface area estimates; these rates are lower than those reported for wildlife aerial surveys. Error in fish species identification was estimated from validation data at 3.9% for herring, and 20. 2% for sand lance; we were not able to discriminate age classes of herring and a model did not improve discrimination. We recommended methods to reduce the cost of obtaining validation samples for future surveys. We determined the precision of fish abundance estimates by performing repeat flyovers; our error rate was 14.6% for school counts and 18.3% for total school surface area estimates within a 36 hr period; surveyor bias is imbedded in this estimate. The variance of the density estimates will be mainly influenced by the variability of biological occurrence since the variance of the detection correction factor including surveyor bias was very low. The additional contribution of error from identification and repeatability of measurements is species specific. For herring the additional error for schools counts, 12 - 18.5%, and surface area estimates, 15.2 - 22.2%, should be applied depending on whether or not the redundancy for surveyor bias is removed. For sand lance, the additional error is 27.7 - 34.2% for school counts and 30.9 - 37.9% for school surface area estimates. The spatial resolution of our data was established at approximately 500 m, but could be reduced with uninterrupted coordinate logging to 80 m. If a finer resolution or degree of precision is required, the technique can be combined with electronic imaging methods reviewed here. Finally, we recommended a field survey design combining new and old technology to provide cost-effective, yet reasonably accurate and precise results.

Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) surveys, 1998 - 1999:
Study History: Restoration Project 99163-T was initiated after a round of data sharing between the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) project, Restoration Project 99320, and the Alaska Predator Ecosystem Experiment (APEX) project, Restoration Project 99163. In the 1998 annual meeting and review for Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) science the principal investigator of this project present data on broad-scale distributions of surface schooling forage fishes in Prince William Sound from 1995-1997. In addition, modelers working with the APEX project found a significant correlation between foraging activity of sea birds and the fish distributions from the aerial surveys. It was decided at that meeting that an aerial component should be added to the APEX program to provide additional information on fish distribution for modelers and other researchers with the APEX umbrella. Therefore, this project was conceived to as a service and data delivery project for that program. The first field season was 1998 and a second (final) field season was completed in 1999. 

Abstract: The objective of this project was to provide information on pelagic schooling fishes in the surface waters of Prince William Sound in order to better understand reproductive and foraging dynamics of various sea bird species. The scope of the project focuses on the study areas of the APEX project within Prince William Sound, Alaska. The individual objectives for this project were completed between the dates of July 1 and August 9, 1998. Preliminary data was delivered to the APEX program via Glen Ford, APEX modeler. Net catches from our survey and other APEX projects were compiled to provide corrections for species identification. Final edited data was delivered on December 14, 1998. We were not able to over fly the acoustics program within APEX due to a non- overlap in over flights and cruises. However, we were able to conduct a single broad-scale survey within Prince William Sound during the course of July, 1998. In meeting our objectives, we flew 15 repeat surveys over the northern and central study regions and 5 repeat surveys (coordinating with kittiwake researchers) over the Jackpot study region (coordinating with marbled murrelet researchers).

Earlier studies stated that there are only a few streams in Prince William Sound with these species, but after consultation with local residents, it appeared these fish were more widespread than previously believed. Given these uncertainties, we consulted local residents, government agencies, Native groups, and other knowledgeable individuals to determine where these species could be found. Streams and lake systems were surveyed by field crews to determine the presence or absence of these species. We found 29 lakes and streams which had undocumented populations of these and other anadromous fish species. The number of undocumented populations by species were as follows: 23 Dolly Varden, 21 cutthroat trout, 14 coho salmon (O. kisutch), two sockeye salmon (O. nerka), and one chum salmon (O. keta). Six resident Dolly Varden and six resident cutthroat trout populations were also identified. The results of this study are being used to update the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, or Migration of Anadromous Fishes, (Anadromous Waters Catalog) and assist the research being conducted under EVOS project 96145.

Longlines were set near schools of herring located during hydroacoustic surveys conducted the previous day. For all six cruises we supplemented information on potential predators using variable-mesh gill nets placed perpendicular to shore. For each cruise, we collected up to 30 individuals of each species captured from the combined longline and gill net sets in the sampled bay. Fish were measured (TL, mm) and weighed (g) prior to removal of stomachs for dietary analyses. Stomach contents were analyzed in the laboratory to determine diet composition. Gut contents were sorted into gross taxonomic categories, enumerated and weighed (g). All fish prey items (fish tissue, otoliths and bones such as jaws, vertebrae, etc. as well as partially and fully intact fish prey) were shipped to a second laboratory.

Important among these factors is the pre-winter condition of juvenile (age-0) herring and the effects of water temperatures on their metabolism. Studies of the physical oceanography of nursery fjords during the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program indicate that each site has a unique set of hydrographic conditions that are influenced by both local processes and water exchange between the Gulf of Alaska and PWS. These factors vary significantly depending on geographic location, basin morphometry, watershed topography and proximity to sources of glacial water. This dataset includes the following: 1) temperature and salinity data collected by moored and profiled CTDs; and 2) thermistors strung at specific depth intervals on the moorings. The data were collected from 2010 to 2012, and built upon a 2007-2008 study funded by the EVOSTC (entitled Physical Oceanographic Factors Affecting Productivity in Juvenile Pacific Herring Nursery Habitats, EVOS project numbers: 070817, 080817, 090817) by continuing a hydrographic time series within the four principal PWS nursery fjords: Simpson Bay, Eaglek Bay, Whale Bay, and Zaikof Bay. The data are given in ASCII format, which can be read by any type of text viewing software, such as UNIX based Awk or Generic Mapping Tool (GMT), data visualization and spreadsheet software such as Matlab and Excel, and Microsoft programs such as Notepad and Wordpad. The data are in both raw and processed forms, the latter including quality checking, data reduction and averaging (where appropriate). The CTDs include an SB19plus for profiles, and SB16.03s, SB37s and an SB19.03 for moored data. Pre-cruise and post-cruise calibrations were performed on the instruments before and after program completion.","Physical Oceanographic Characteristics of Herring Nursery Habitats in Prince William Sound, 2010-2012, EVOS Herring Program","Shelton Gay"

As part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132), from March 2010 through March 2012 castnets and gillnets were deployed in bays of Prince William Sound to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March. In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations. A list of these projects and the associated EVOS project numbers is provided in Supplemental Information.","Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring, 2010-2016: EVOS Herring Program","Mary Anne Bishop"

Gulf Watch Alaska is the long-term ecosystem monitoring program of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council for the marine ecosystem affected by the 1989 oil spill. Beginning in March 2007, monitoring of marine bird abundance, distribution, species composition, and habitat associations commenced using multiple surveys during fall and winter (September-March). Data was collected under three separate EVOS-funded projects each with different objectives. Refer to funding chronology under Supplemental Information for project-specific objectives. In particular, this dataset contains marine bird observation data in Prince William Sound (PWS) from 2007-2017. The dataset includes 11 comma-separated value (csv) files exported from the marine bird and mammal observation software dLOG (Ford Consulting, Inc., Portland OR 1999) for each winter the survey was conducted (March 2007, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2016/17). Depending on the winter and project, marine bird observations were collected in September, October, November, December, January, February, and March. All marine bird observations were conducted using established U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) protocols (USFWS 2007). Except for the March 2007 survey, all surveys record number of birds sighted by observers within a strip transect width of 300 m (150 m both sides and ahead of the boat, in 3 distance bins of 50 m) made by a research vessel. In March 2007, the strip-width was 200 m. The observer recorded observations into a laptop computer integrated with a global positioning system (GPS) using the program Dlog. The GPS-integrated program provided location data at 15-sec intervals and for every entered observation. Because surveys were conducted in conjunction with different research programs, observations were typically conducted under one of two scenarios: while boats were transiting between areas or, in the case of juvenile herring surveys, observations were conducted in juvenile herring survey bays along a zigzag track, approximately 200 m or greater from shore that coincides with the same transect line as the nocturnal hydroacoustic juvenile herring surveys. In the later years, the project expanded from placing bird observers on-board EVOS-sponsored PWS Science Center juvenile herring surveys and NOAA Humpback Whale surveys to include two additional ships of opportunity as observation platforms. These include: Alaska Department of Fish and Game spot-shrimp cruise and the Ocean Tracking Network maintenance cruise.","Fall and Winter Seabird Abundance Data, Prince William Sound, 2007-2017, Gulf Watch Alaska Pelagic Component","Mary Anne Bishop"

In Prince William Sound (PWS) adult herring disperse after spawning, however their movement patterns are poorly understood. Acoustic telemetry is a tool used to track fish to understand more about their seasonal movements. This project (EVOS project numbers: 12120111-B, 13120111-B, 14120111-B) tested the utility of acoustic tags for tracking the seasonal migrations of adult herring into and out of PWS. In April 2012 and 2013 adult herring were captured on their spawning grounds in Port Gravina (northeast PWS) using jigs. The herring were then sedated, measured and a small acoustic tag surgically implanted. In 2012 25 herring were acoustically tagged, and 69 herring were tagged in 2013. Post release tagged herring were monitored by acoustic receiver arrays with two receivers located near the entrance to Port Gravina (on the eastern and western side) through 19 May 2012, when data was uploaded. In 2013, coverage in Port Gravina was expanded and included an array of nine receivers. Receivers were deployed in Port Gravina from 7-8 April through 21 May 2013 when receivers were removed. As part of the Ocean Tracking network (www.oceantrackingnetwork.org), receiver arrays were also deployed across the principal entrances into the Sound from the Gulf of Alaska during March 2013. Arrays were located at Hinchinbrook Entrance, Montague Strait, and the four southwest passages in Prince William Sound. Data from the Ocean Tracking Network arrays were uploaded in February and May 2014, after transmitters had expired. Tag life on transmitters was estimated at ~ 263 days. This dataset contains four comma-separated values (csv) files each containing the tagging log and acoustic receiver detection log for each tagging year (e.g. 2012 and 2013). The files named 'Herring Tagging Log' describe the length and weight measurements and spawning-state characteristics for each acoustic tagged fish. The files named 'AcousticTaggedHerringDetections' are acoustic receiver detection logs containing the data, time, and location of tagged herring detections. Ocean Tracking Network Array Expansion, 2016 In 2013, we documented post-spawn migration of herring from Port Gravina to the PWS entrances by acoustic tagging adult herring and collecting data from the Ocean Tracking Network acoustic arrays. The 2013 study, however, could not verify if herring were migrating out into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and then returning to PWS because of the single-line layout of the Ocean Tracking Network arrays. The February 2017 acoustic array expansion created a double-line of receivers in known areas of high traffic by herring at the Ocean Tracking Network. This will allow PWSSC researchers to document adult herring migration movements out from and into PWS, and to better understand factors that influence migration patterns including age, condition, spawning location, and residency in PWS. The dataset contains one csv file containing array location, station name, deploy latitude, deploy longitude, and deploy depth for the receivers deployed during February 2017 as part of project 16160111-S.","Tracking Seasonal Movements of Adult Pacific Herring in Prince William Sound, 2012-2016, EVOS Herring Program.

As part of the Prince William Sound Herring Survey Program (EVOS project number 10100132), from March 2010 through March 2012 castnets and gillnets were deployed in bays of Prince William Sound to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March. In the Cordova harbor castnets were also used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Beginning in February 2012, a second study titled ""PWS Herring Research and Monitoring: Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring Using Direct Capture"" (hereafter referred to as the Direct Capture project"") was funded by EVOS as part of an effort to validate herring population estimates and support other herring-related investigations from 2010-2016 (EVOS project numbers 12120111-A, 13120111-A. 14120111-A. 15120111-A, and 16120111-A). Slightly overlapping with the end of the previous PWS Herring Survey project 10100132, field work continued throughout Prince William Sound using castnets and gillnets to validate hydroacoustic surveys as well as to provide an index of juvenile herring during March.In the Cordova harbor, castnets continued to be used to sample juvenile herring during various months of the year. Importantly, for the Direct Capture project, a mid-water trawl was purchased for use in additional sampling in conjunction with herring hydroacoustic surveys. Problems with hydraulics prevented its use during the November 2012 herring cruise, however, the trawl was used for all subsequent juvenile herring hydroacoustic surveys. The Direct Capture project collected the data needed to estimate useful population level parameters for PWS Pacific herring obtained from acoustic surveys by coupling acoustic transects with direct-capture sampling efforts. Based on the acoustic surveys that occurred during spring and fall research cruises, targeted areas were identified and returned to for short-distance (0.1-1.6 km) trawls concomitant with acoustic surveys. At these targeted locations mid-water trawls were conducted. In addition, gillnet and cast nets were used when the boat was at anchor. The 2010-2016 dataset is comma-separated values (csv) files exported from a Microsoft Access database. The data contain measurements of collected fish; logs of gear deployment and catches; a master list of all survey cruises; and collection report summaries (available only for 2010-2012). Fish collected were sorted by species, the total of each species was weighed, and up to 200 fish of each species were individually weighed and measured. Measured herring were grouped into three age categories for purposes of analysis based on standard length: young-of-year (age-0; less than 105 mm), age-1 (106-150 mm), and age-2+ (greater than 150 mm). For 2013-2016, environmental data, including conductivity, temperature, and depth, were also collected during trawl transects using a sensor attached to the trawl gear. Fish collected were later sent to various projects associated with the PWS herring programs for additional analysis, including disease, energetics, and genetics investigations. A list of these projects and the associated EVOS project numbers is provided in Supplemental Information.","Validation of Acoustic Surveys for Pacific Herring, 2010-2016: EVOS Herring Program","Mary Anne Bishop"

Past research of juvenile Pacific herring in PWS has shown that recruitment is highly influenced by conditions within nursery sites affecting survival within the first year. Important among these factors is the pre-winter condition of juvenile (age-0) herring and the effects of water temperatures on their metabolism. Studies of the physical oceanography of nursery fjords during the Sound Ecosystem Assessment (SEA) program indicate that each site has a unique set of hydrographic conditions that are influenced by both local processes and water exchange between the Gulf of Alaska and PWS. These factors vary significantly depending on geographic location, basin morphometry, watershed topography and proximity to sources of glacial water. This dataset includes the following: 1) temperature and salinity data collected by moored and profiled CTDs; and 2) thermistors strung at specific depth intervals on the moorings. The data were collected from 2010 to 2012, and built upon a 2007-2008 study funded by the EVOSTC (entitled Physical Oceanographic Factors Affecting Productivity in Juvenile Pacific Herring Nursery Habitats, EVOS project numbers: 070817, 080817, 090817) by continuing a hydrographic time series within the four principal PWS nursery fjords: Simpson Bay, Eaglek Bay, Whale Bay, and Zaikof Bay. The data are given in ASCII format, which can be read by any type of text viewing software, such as UNIX based Awk or Generic Mapping Tool (GMT), data visualization and spreadsheet software such as Matlab and Excel, and Microsoft programs such as Notepad and Wordpad. The data are in both raw and processed forms, the latter including quality checking, data reduction and averaging (where appropriate). The CTDs include an SB19plus for profiles, and SB16.03s, SB37s and an SB19.03 for moored data.

These GPS-integrated programs provided location data at 15-sec intervals and for every entered observation. Because surveys were conducted in conjunction with different research programs, observations were typically conducted under one of two scenarios: while boats were transiting between areas or, in the case of juvenile herring surveys, observations were conducted in juvenile herring survey bays along a zigzag track, approximately 200 m or greater from shore that coincides with the same transect line as the nocturnal hydroacoustic juvenile herring surveys.

These measurements were collected by a Seabird 9 CTD and associated sensors on a CTD rosette lowered from a ship at discrete stations during cruises for the Northern Gulf of Alaska Long Term Ecological Research (NGA LTER) project. Three cruises occurred from 2018-2021 - spring, summer, and fall. Ships conducting the cruises include R/V Tiglax (TGX), R/V Sikuliaq (SKQ), and R/V Wolstad (WSD). R/V Sikuliaq provides her own CTD instrument, but for the other, smaller, ships, the instrument is provided by the NGA LTER program. The CTDs have dual temperature and conductivity sensors; from these measurements, salinity and density (as sigma-t) were calculated. CTDs are also outfitted with dual SBE 43 oxygen sensors, a WET Labs C-Star to measure light transmission and attenuation, a WET Labs ECO-AFL/FL to measure chlorophyll fluorescence, and a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor. Additional instruments include a Deep-SUNA to optically measure nitrate and a LISST to measure particle size and concentration. Another instrument on the rosette (an underwater Vision Profiler UVP whose data is not included here) required a long soak at 30 m that may have impacted depiction of the near-surface stratification. Data from each cruise are presented in 3 formats: vertical profiles of 1 dbar averages in netCDF and CSV formats, and data corresponding to the times of Niskin water bottle sampling in CSV format.

This data set consists of 14 files describing cardiovascular health of herring exposed to oil, herring mortality, body metrics and fatty acid composition, juvenile and larval growth metrics, lipid development over time and overwinter in distinct herring populations, swim performance, and mortality information for oiled and unoiled herring exposed to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and infection by Ichthyophonus. This data was collected as part of NPRB project 1712, “Reduced recruitment of Pacific herring due to oil spill impacts on early development, growth, and disease resistance”. The herring population in Prince William Sound (PWS) crashed 3 to 4 years after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS), and has not recovered. Although a role for the spill in the rapid decline of herring was never determined, population-level effects were demonstrated on fish that were easier to study, such as pink salmon. This project found that herring are much more sensitive to toxicity from oil exposure than previously known. Exposure of developing herring embryos to extremely low levels of crude oil (oil compounds measured at parts per trillion) caused them to grow into outwardly normal looking juvenile fish that had subtly malformed hearts and reduced cardio-respiratory performance (physical capacity).","Mortality, growth metrics and lipid composition of embryonic and juvenile Pacific herring for Prince William Sound in Alaska, 2018","John Incardona"
